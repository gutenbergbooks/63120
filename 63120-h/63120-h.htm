<p>In presenting the following narrative of
suffering endured while a prisoner in the so-called
Southern Confederacy, the principal
object had in view by the author, is to place
before those into whose hands this volume may
come, a plain, straightforward, unvarnished
account of <i>facts</i>.</p>

<p>In regard to the workings and results of that
system of human bondage to which our country
owes its present difficulties, there have been so
many mistaken ideas, statements, and theories,
that it has become the duty of every true and
loyal man to expose the truth; or, speaking
with more correctness, to strip from the hideous
skeleton of Slavery all its gaily painted and
deceptive cloaks and masks, and to exhibit it in
all its ghastly repulsiveness.</p>

<p>It is my purpose in the succeeding pages to
narrate simply how, after being captured at the
battle of Shiloh, or Pittsburg Landing, I was,
on the most frivolous charges, tried for my life
before several prominent Rebel Generals, among
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
whom were Bragg and Beauregard; how I was
subsequently chained with negro chains and
cast into military prisons and common jails;
how, escaping from these, and in company with
Lieutenant <span class="smcap">A. P. Collins</span>, I made my way to
the swamps; how we lived in these malarious
marshes for three weeks; how we were hunted
with bloodhounds; how we were assisted by
the slaves in our flight, and lastly, how, being
recaptured, we spent weary months in confinement,
and were finally released on exchange
from our dreadful captivity.</p>

<p>To all those friends who have cheered him since his return home with
kind words and deeds, the author begs leave to extend his warmest
thanks,&mdash;but more especially to Rev. <span class="smcap">Alexander
Clark</span>, Editor of <i>Clark’s School Visitor</i>, who revised and
arranged the Manuscripts for the press, and to whose scholarly abilities
this volume owes so much. He desires also to testify to like kindness on
the part of Rev.&nbsp;<span class="smcap">W. B. Watkins</span>, A. M., and
<span class="smcap">Milo A. Townsend</span>, Esq., of New Brighton,
Pennsylvania, whose friendship has laid him under a debt of grateful
remembrance.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<p>John James Geer was born in Rockbridge
county, Virginia, June 1st, 1833. He is next
to the youngest of a family of nine children.
The father emigrated to Ohio when John was
quite young, and settled in Shelby county, where
he lived and labored as an industrious farmer
for a long lifetime. Being in moderate circumstances,
he was unable to educate his children as
he wished, as their young hands were an indispensable
help in the clearing and tilling of the
land; but the lads wrought for themselves a
training and discipline in the fields and at the
fireside, such as made honest-hearted heroes of
them.</p>

<p>Though this tuition may not be the most
fashionable, it is far from being the least useful
or influential in a nation like ours. The only
external polish that will never grow coarse is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
the out-shining of inward purity and kindness.
The law of love is a sufficient code of politeness
and etiquette. The rarest soul-furnishing, and
the most radiant and reliable loyalty, are virtuous
intelligence, an appreciation of the true and
the beautiful in Nature, in mind and morals, the
utterance of generous impulses, the self-respect
that prefers its own calm approval to the world’s
admiration and flattery. Such a heroism is
purely democratic, and sets the price of its integrity
too high to offer itself as a prize for party
bidding! It stands like a granite pillar, strong,
and straight, and upright. We may build on
this, and stand secure for solid years. It is this
untrammeled life the nation needs at this very
time in the hearts of all her citizens.</p>

<p>Mr. Geer never received any lessons in the
school of pretences. He never learned the art
of deceiving or being deceived. He studied
something deeper of the world while his hands
held the plough that furrowed its surface. He
gained more instruction from the leaves on the
forest trees than from the leaves of printed books.
He cultivated at one and the same time his own
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
mind, and the soil of his father’s farm. His surroundings
were the pictures and poetries of Nature.
His eye saw no shams, his ear heard no
complaints, his heart knew no hypocrisies.
Trained in such a school, he became a thinker
and a worker; his associations were altogether
with plain and practical people; he was never
flushed with feverish fancies, nor discouraged at
any disappointments. Always cheerful, as only a
busy doer and darer can be, he grew into manhood,
full-built, tough-muscled, keen-nerved, and
strong-minded. He acquired by hygienic habits
a “constitution” that needed never an “amendment.”
He shaped, all unconsciously to himself,
a moral character as honorable as it was humble;
yet it was such as recognized in the minutest
particular, and exacted to the fullest degree, the
claims of a common brotherhood.</p>

<p>Pure democracy, like all living, blossoming,
fruit-bearing growths, flourishes best in the
country. A principle that strikes root in an hour
in the hotbed of the city, is apt to wilt and die in
the sunshine of the open world. Aristocracy
may be plaited into politics; but it takes integrity
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
and fellow-hood for web and woof of republicanism.
Young Geer was a democrat, in the
honest signification of the term. Though poor
and sunburnt,
hard-fisted and plain-worded, he
learned to feel that no man in the republic was
his superior in rights&mdash;that no man in the republic
was his inferior in privileges. The truth of
Holy Writ, that declares “all nations to be of
one blood,” was his confession of faith in conscience
and Christianity. The spirit of the Declaration
of Independence, that “all men are
created free and equal,” was his political platform.
These high authorities gave him early
and earnest boldness as a friend of human liberty.</p>

<p>At the age of eighteen, he was called to the
work of the Gospel ministry. He passed into
this work, not as a mere <i>profession</i>, by the paths
marked out by ecclesiastics,&mdash;not by college carpets
and seminary shades,&mdash;but as the early
preachers were called, so was he, from his daily
avocation. His inherent firmness made him an
unyielding, if not an aggressive Christian. He
stemmed a strong current of opposition from the
beginning of his ministry. His independent
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
manner gave offence to rowdy transgressors, and
frequently was he threatened and waylaid by
the very doers of the deeds he made it a business
to denounce in his sermons. But he wavered
not from his sense of duty.</p>

<p>One of his first and truest friends was the
Rev. <span class="smcap">R. M. Dalby</span>, a well-known minister and
Temperance reformer in South-western Ohio.
These two men were acknowledged leaders in
the war of annihilation against King Alcohol
and his conscripted hosts. For years they were
joined in word and work in the good cause of
Temperance, and were separated only when,
in the spring of 1861, Geer heard his wounded
country’s cry for help, and quickly stepped to
a place in the front rank of her brave defenders.
His well-tried associate in battling against
wrong, Mr. Dalby, was left behind now, only
because he was physically unable to march
to the rescue.</p>

<p>Before entering the army of the Union, Mr.
Geer had spent some ten years in the ministry,
in and around the city of Cincinnati. During
that time he received about eleven hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
members into the church. He was eminently
successful as a revivalist. When Fort Sumpter
was fired upon, he was stationed as pastor of the
George Street Methodist Protestant Church, in
Cincinnati. When the news of the outrage was
received at the Queen City, the pastor of George
Street Church vowed he was a United States
soldier until either himself or the rebellion
should be crushed. He began recruiting at
once for the Army of Freedom, and was as
successful as he had been in marshaling forces
for the Army of Peace.</p>

<p>Until this time he had been unwilling to
interfere with the “peculiar institution” of the
South. But the moment the Stars and Stripes
were insulted by the proud power, that moment
a new resolve was made, to hate and to hurt the
accursed thing henceforward, until the last
vestige of it should be obliterated from American
soil!</p>

<p>Captain Geer is an earnest man. He engaged
in the war, not for position or popularity, but
as a soldier. Although he started into the service
as Chaplain, he was willing to resign that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
responsible office to the charge of another; and
at once accepted a position that promised more
excitement and adventure in days of battle. He
was appointed Assistant-Adjutant General on
the Staff of General Buckland, which commission
he held when he was wounded and captured at
Shiloh.</p>

<p>In these days of adventure and sacrifice,
when the noblest men in the nation are made
to suffer for country’s sake, it is shameful to
see how certain northern people and papers,
professing to be loyal, are in sympathy with
the arch-treason of the Secessionists. However
well-attested may be the statements of
surviving sufferers,&mdash;and no matter how fair the
reputation of the man who dares to denounce
the Slaveholders’ Rebellion,&mdash;there are lurking
copperheads with viper tongues to hiss their
venomous abuses on all the brave soldiers who
have bled under the Federal banner! From the
liberty to talk treason, slander the Administration,
and abuse the soldiers&mdash;O God, deliver us!
The nation cries for <i>liberty</i>&mdash;not license&mdash;a
liberty that is always loyal to God and this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Government&mdash;a liberty to love and bless the
poor, the outcast, the suffering, and the oppressed!</p>

<p class="chapsum">Leave Camp Dennison&mdash;Under the Enemy’s
Fire&mdash;Attacked in Force&mdash;A Struggle for Liberty&mdash;Captured.</p>

<p class="noindent">On the 17th of February, 1862, the Forty-eighth
Ohio regiment of volunteer infantry, under
command of Colonel P. G. Sullivan, left Camp
Dennison, landing at Paducah, Kentucky, and
on the 4th of March, was ordered to Savannah,
Tennessee. As our fleet made its way up the
river, it was a sight at once grand and beautiful.
It was composed of one hundred large
steamers, laden to the guards with soldiers, cattle,
and munitions of war. The river was at
high water mark. Through its surging waters
our noble vessels ploughed their way, sending
forth vast volumes of smoke, which shadowed
and sooted the atmosphere from hill to hill across
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
the river valley. Over our heads waved proudly
the old banner&mdash;emblem of the free. All hearts
seemed anxious to meet the foe who had sought
to strike down that flag, and the hopes and
liberties of which it is representative.</p>

<p>A cry was heard on board that the enemy
was near. A moment more, and he opened fire
upon us, to which we very promptly replied,
and with good effect, for he soon dispersed,
while none of our men received injury.</p>

<p>Continuing our way onward we stopped at
Hamburg on the 11th of March; but, owing to
the great freshet, were unable to disembark, and
the next day were obliged to fall back to Pittsburg,
where we effected a landing on the 13th.
In the mean time, I was appointed on the staff
of Colonel Ralph D. Buckland, then acting as
Brigadier of the Fourth Brigade, under General
Sherman, who commanded the First Division.
Most of us landed by the 15th, and parties were
sent out every day to reconnoitre, and many
returned, reporting fights with the enemy, and
the capture of prisoners, horses, and other
valuables.</p>

<p>On the 28th, we had quite a bloody conflict
in a cotton-field, belonging to Mr. Beach, who
was the owner of a small lot of cotton. The
rebels had robbed him of all his horses, pork,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
and wheat, leaving him nothing but the cotton
and a small amount of corn, which the Government
intended to purchase. But when we were
dispatched for it, we found that the rebels, who
were now in full retreat, had rolled the cotton
against a corn-crib, and set both on fire. The
next day we had a fight near the same spot.
Again, the next day, a reconnaissance showed
the enemy to be in full force. On the 3d of
April, the Fourth Brigade was sent out, and the
skirmishers who were deployed, were soon fired
upon. Col. Buckland then sent me forward to
order the two companies to retreat. One of
these I found was already doing so, under
the command of the Major, who was in advance.
The company belonging to the Seventy-second
regiment stood their ground, awaiting
orders.</p>

<p>When I rode to the top of the hill, I could
see the enemy about two hundred yards distant.
The lieutenant of the Seventy-second
was holding his men in readiness, and just as I
reached them, they arose and opened fire, at
which the rebels retreated to the right, evidently
intending to flank us. But this was an
unfortunate movement for them, as they had
not proceeded far when they encountered Major
Crockett, of the Seventy-second, with two
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
hundred men, by whom they were repulsed
with heavy loss. By this time I had come up
with the brigade. Buckland dispatched me immediately
to order Crockett to fall back, but to
continue fighting while retreating. As I proceeded
on my way to Crockett&mdash;who, indeed,
was a brave and daring officer&mdash;I met a
lady of advanced age, in great distress. She
was wringing her hands and crying:</p>

<p>“Oh, my son! Oh, my son! Save me and
my poor son!”</p>

<p>I rode forward to Crockett, and found that he
had repulsed the enemy, and was falling back
in order.</p>

<p>Being alone, and in advance of the retreating
companies, I again encountered the old lady on
the same spot where I first saw her. Inquiring
the cause of her grief, I learned that the rebels
had been at her house, representing themselves
as Union men, and that she had expressed herself
to them, without disguise or reserve. They
had thereupon seized her son, tied him on a
horse, and bore him away, intending to press
him into their service. My heart ached at the
recital of this sad story, and at the thought of
the suffering and agony to which so many families,
between the two great armies, would be
subjected. My sincere prayer to God, was that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
he would sustain the right, and send confusion
amidst the foes of freedom and humanity. The
old lady seemed very apprehensive they would
learn that she had divulged to me the facts
alluded to. Thus it is by <i>fear</i> that the loyal in
heart are kept in submission. Thus, the tyrant’s
power rules and dominates in the South.
Wherever oppression and tyranny reign, they
must have for their basis, violence and brute
force&mdash;and these beget fear. It is as true that
fear casts out love, as it is that “love casts out
fear.”</p>

<p>We returned to camp, and that night we felt
confident that our pickets were in danger. The
dreary hours passed slowly away, bringing at
last the light of another morning. Our pickets
were then extended; and on returning from this
duty, I remarked to Buckland that I believed
we would be attacked before night. But he
thought not, and requested me to retire to my
tent, and seek repose. I went, but concluded
to write to my wife. About two o’clock that
afternoon, the rebels opened fire upon our
picket. I instantly mounted my horse that I
had left standing at the door, and rode with all
speed to the picket line, where I discovered that
the rebels had captured Lieutenant Herbert and
seven privates. The Seventy-second, Forty-eighth,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
and Seventieth were soon rallied; and I
thought if no fight now ensued, it would be no
fault of mine, eager as I was for the fray. So
I rode rapidly up the Tennessee river, in order
to strike the Hamburg road, aware that I could
see up that road about one mile, and thus discover
what was going on.</p>

<p>As I was proceeding, I perceived, at a little
distance, two rebels, who fled at my approach.
I soon reached the road, and discovered, to my
great surprise, that it was lined with rebels as
far as I could see. I soon wheeled my horse,
and, with accelerated speed, made my way back
to General Buckland. He again dispatched me
to inform Major Crockett to retreat in order.</p>

<p>On my way thither, these words greeted my
ear:</p>

<p>“Halt dar! halt dar!”</p>

<p>I responded by firing my revolver, as a signal
that I did not design to comply with the
peremptory demand so euphoniously expressed.
The words proceeded from two rebels, whom I
discovered approaching me. They fired, and
both loads took effect in my horse’s shoulder.
But he did not fall. Applying my spurs, he
sprang down a little declivity, where the rebels
stood with their empty guns. One of them
struck at me with his empty weapon. I attempted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
to parry the blow with my left hand,
and received a severe wound, having my second
finger broken, which was thus rendered useless
for life. The instant discharge of my revolver
resulted in breaking an arm of this foe, and I
immediately turned to my second antagonist,
who was hastily reloading his gun. The contents
of another barrel at once disabled him.
This was all the work of a moment. Just at
this juncture, it began to rain in torrents; and
before I realized my situation, I discovered that
I was surrounded by about fifty rebels. The
rain and the darkness in the woods, from the
overhanging storm-cloud, rendered it difficult
for the rebels to distinguish their own men
from ours, and they made the mistake&mdash;fortunately
for me, but the reverse for them&mdash;of
firing at each other. Their colonel, however,
soon discovered the error, and gave the command
to cease firing. There was now no possible
chance for my escape, and I instantly
received a blow which felled me to the earth.
How long I remained insensible I could not
tell. The first thing I recollect taking cognizance
of, was the act of Colonel Gladden, who,
dragging me out of a pool of water into which
I had fallen, demanded my surrender. I seemed
to lose all thought of home, wife, friends,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
earth, or heaven. The absorbing thought was
the success of our army.</p>

<p>“Will you surrender?” demanded Colonel
Gladden.</p>

<p>“I have discharged my last bullet, sir,” I
replied.</p>

<p>He commanded me to mount my horse. I
refused. My captors then seized hold of me,
and, throwing me across my wounded horse,
made a rapid retreat. Our boys were coming
at “double quick,” and so impetuous was their
charge towards the enemy, who was now approaching&mdash;consisting
of Beauregard’s advance
guard of five thousand cavalry&mdash;that they began
retreating in wild confusion. More than a
hundred riderless horses ran dashing past me.
The conflict became general and terrific, and
the mighty, sweeping onset of our brave boys
was only stayed by the opening of Bragg’s
front battery, which incessantly poured forth its
shot and shell. During this interim, myself
and the guards detailed to take charge of me
were located in a ravine, and hence the cannon
shots passed over our heads. A rifle-ball from
one of our men, however, at this juncture,
brought one of the guards from his horse. A
rebel colonel approached him, saying, “You
are too good a <i>man</i> to die so.” At this moment
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
a second ball pierced the heart of the rebel
colonel, and he dropped dead.</p>

<p>It was here that my horse fell and died, and
I felt as if a friend had gone, whose place could
not be easily filled.</p>

<p>There was a wild and gloomy grandeur in
this battle-storm raging and booming over
our heads like ten thousand thunders; and my
heart was tremulous with hope at one moment,
and with apprehension at another, for the fate
of our gallant braves. Alas! my soul mourned
when I found they had been driven back by
the overwhelming force of the enemy.</p>

<p class="chapsum">First Sight of a Rebel Camp&mdash;Arraigned before Generals
Jackson, Bragg, Hardee, Beauregard and Johnson&mdash;A
Storm in Camp&mdash;Bayoneting a Sleeping Man (?)&mdash;Inside
View of a Rebel Prison&mdash;“Calico Bill”&mdash;An Escape&mdash;Rebel
Exaggerations.</p>

<p class="noindent">In due time, I was conveyed to General Jackson. What
a scene was opened to view! What a motley, mongrel, nondescript crowd
did rebeldom here present! Old and young, bond and free, small and
great, black and white, with countenances forlorn, agonized, or
ferocious, with limbs mangled and torn. Sorrowful were the wailings of
the wounded, and bitter the imprecations of the chagrined and
discomfited crew.</p>

<p>Colonel Gladden and four privates were my
escort to Jackson’s tent.</p>

<p>“I have brought you a Yankee, General,”
said Colonel Gladden.</p>

<p>The rebel general inquired of me my rank.
I declined telling him. I was then asked for
papers and upon making examination, they
found with me maps of the Hamburg road,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
and a small rebel fortification. As soon as
they made this discovery, Jackson inquired:</p>

<p>“Sir, what is the number of your men?”</p>

<p>“We have a small skirmishing party, General,”
I replied. “You have not captured them
all to-day, and you will not to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” he answered sharply, “you know the
number, and if you do not inform me, and that
promptly, I shall have you punished.”</p>

<p>“I shall not inform you,” said I, coolly;
“you affirm that you are going there to-morrow,
and if so, you can then see for yourself.”</p>

<p>Somewhat enraged at this, he again threatened
that he would punish me.</p>

<p>“Proceed with your punishment, sir,” was my
rejoinder; “but I shall reveal to you nothing
that I think it my duty to withhold.”</p>

<p>“I will refer you to General Bragg,” said
Jackson.</p>

<p>“Refer me to whom you please.”</p>

<p>I was then taken before General Bragg. On
our way thither, much excitement prevailed in
the crowd, to many of whom the sight of a
Yankee was as great a curiosity as one of Du
Chaillu’s famous gorillas. Various remarks
saluted my ear, such as “What a big man he
is.” “Why! do Yankees look that thar way?”
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
“Why! golly, they’re better looking fellows nor
we are.”</p>

<p>Such expressions are significant of that stratum
of society which exists in the South to an
almost incredible extent.</p>

<p>When we arrived at General Bragg’s quarters,
some men were engaged in placing in a
rude box, the body of a man who had been
shot by Bragg’s orders, for attempting to escape
to our lines. I was not without apprehensions
that such would be my own fate. Still, my
mind was more occupied as to what was to be
the result of the battle that had just begun.
The long-haired monster in human shape stood
over the dead man’s remains, swearing that “it
was good enough for him.” Just as we were
entering Bragg’s tent, a rough, uncouth-looking
fellow, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Tarnation! are you going to shoot this
ere fellow?” pointing to me.</p>

<p>“No,” said one of the guards, “we are going
to keep him for a show, by golly.”</p>

<p>I began soon to realize that the chances for
my life were growing less and less. The
charges arrayed against me, were for firing and
killing six men, after I had been surrounded.
I neither affirmed nor denied. The full results
of my firing I did not know. I made up my
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
mind, however, that whatever fate was before
me, I would exhibit no shrinking or fear. It
seemed probable that my doom was to be shot,
and I felt impelled to answer their interrogatories
in a somewhat defiant manner. The following
dialogue ensued:</p>

<p><i>Bragg.</i> “Well, sir, you are a prisoner.”</p>

<p><i>Geer.</i> “You have me in your power, sir.”</p>

<p><i>B.</i> “You have not surrendered, they say.”</p>

<p><i>G.</i> “But you have me in your possession.”</p>

<p><i>B.</i> “Well, sir, what is the number of your
troops at Pittsburg Landing?”</p>

<p><i>G.</i> “That I do not feel disposed to communicate.”</p>

<p><i>B.</i> “But we will make you communicate.”</p>

<p><i>G.</i> “You cannot do that.”</p>

<p><i>B.</i> “We will punish you, and that severely.”</p>

<p><i>G.</i> “Punish if you will, I shall not reveal to
you anything I deem it proper to withhold.”</p>

<p><i>B.</i> “Well, sir, I will refer you to General
Hardee, and there you will get justice. You
abolitionists think you are playing h&mdash;ll over
there, don’t you?”</p>

<p><i>G.</i> “We are only sending home some of her
stray inmates.”</p>

<p><i>B.</i> “Be careful how you talk, sir.” Turning
to a rebel officer, the speaker continued: “Colonel,
take this man to General Hardee, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
give him all the particulars.” (<i>Handing him a
note addressed to Hardee.</i>)</p>

<p>I was thereupon placed on a stolen horse, and
conducted to General Hardee.</p>

<p>On my way from Bragg’s to Hardee’s quarters,
my mind was busied with singular fancies.
I thought of rebel treachery and oppression; I
thought of the arch-conspirators at Montgomery,
the disgraceful bombardment of Sumpter,
the murder of United States troops in the
streets of Baltimore, the enslavement of four
millions of Adam’s race, all by the hateful
power that now had me in its clutches. These
atrocities made me the more willing to suffer in
the defense of the Government that I had volunteered
to serve.</p>

<p>Hardee is a noble-looking man, and on this
occasion was dressed in full uniform of blue
cloth.</p>

<p>“General,” said my conductor, “here is a
Yankee officer, referred to you by General
Bragg.”</p>

<p>“For what purpose?” asked the General.</p>

<p>“For examination, sir.”</p>

<p>The General, with a look of surprise and indignation,
replied:</p>

<p>“I shall ask the young man no questions that
I would not answer myself under similar
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
circumstances. But,” added he, after a moment’s
consideration, “I shall send you to General
Beauregard.”</p>

<p>I could hardly repress a smile at this decision,
for now, thought I, I shall see the chiefest rebel
of them all.</p>

<p>We passed through motley crowds of long-haired
“butternuts,” to a place called Monterey.
The General-in-Chief’s headquarters were in a
dilapidated cabin. I was immediately arraigned
before a bony-faced old man with a gray moustache,
not at all prepossessing in personal appearance.
Yet, on closer observation, I could
detect a cunning shrewdness and a penetrating
forethought in his tones and manner.</p>

<p><i>Beauregard.</i> “You have been rather unfortunate
to-day, sir.”</p>

<p><i>Geer.</i> “Yes, sir, a little so to-day, but not so
much on other days.” (I referred to the four
days’ skirmishing prior to the Shiloh fight, in
which we had seriously worsted the rebels.)</p>

<p><i>B.</i> “Sir, they tell me you have not surrendered.”</p>

<p><i>G.</i> “No, sir; but you have me in your
power.”</p>

<p><i>B.</i> “What are your reasons for not surrendering?”</p>

<p><i>G.</i> “I decline telling you, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p><i>B.</i> “But you <i>shall</i> tell me!”</p>

<p><i>G.</i> “If you press me, I will tell you. I surrender
to no foe that can not look me in the
face nationally.”</p>

<p>When I had uttered these words, great excitement
prevailed. In the din and confusion, I
could discover the cry, “Cut his head off!”
But in the midst of the melee, General Beauregard
ordered silence, and said he would refer
me to General Johnson.</p>

<p>As I was leaving Beauregard’s quarters, I
heard that gentleman say:</p>

<p>“We intend to go on from victory to victory,
till we drive you invaders from our soil.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied I, for I felt his remarks
keenly, “just as you did at Fort Donelson.”</p>

<p>I left in the midst of the bitterest imprecations,
escorted by a heavy guard. By this
time it had grown quite dark; and as my
clothing was very wet, I began to suffer with
the cold.</p>

<p>Still conducted by the colonel, I soon came
to Johnson’s headquarters, which were upon the
battle-field. In a tent adjoining that of Johnson,
a court-martial was in session, presided
over by the General, and into this tent I was
taken, where the following colloquy ensued:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Col. G.</i> “General Johnson, I have brought
you a Yankee prisoner, sir.”</p>

<p><i>Gen. J.</i> “Yes, sir.”</p>

<p><i>Col. G.</i> “General, what are you going to do
with him?”</p>

<p><i>Gen. J.</i> “Treat him like a man. Bring in the
surgeon and dress his wounds, and give him
something to eat.”</p>

<p>A colored boy was immediately called, and I
was soon engaged in discussing the merits of a
warm supper. After finishing the meal, I was
taken out and seated by a fire near the tent,
still closely watched and heavily guarded. I
heard the General say to the court-martial that
“the charges against the prisoner were, 1st.
For firing after he was surrounded; 2d. For
injuring our men by firing; and 3d. That he
never surrendered.”</p>

<p>“Now,” said Johnson, “if he had first surrendered,
and then fired and injured our men, he
would have been guilty, and the court-martial
might have condemned him. But inasmuch
as he did <i>not</i> surrender, he is not liable to the
death punishment. In regard to this third
charge, I will remark that you can not legally
court-martial a man for not surrendering. And
now,” continued he, addressing the officers, “do
you know that, if I had been placed in similar
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
circumstances, I would have done just as he
did?”</p>

<p>It would be impossible for me to describe the
emotions I then experienced. Until I heard
this, I had not indulged the faintest hope of life.
Johnson handed me a paper, and said:</p>

<p>“Will you please sign this parole that you
will report at Corinth to-morrow?”</p>

<p>I declined to do this, for I hoped that if I
could make my escape to the Union lines that
night, I could impart information of great value
to our army.</p>

<p>When I declined, the rebel Colonel said,
“There, General, I told you what he was.”
General Johnson replied:</p>

<p>“Detail a guard of six men to take charge of
him, and treat him well.”</p>

<p>The guard was brought, and amidst their
guns and bayonets, I was led away.</p>

<p>They conducted me to a tent on the hill, near
a small ravine, whose waters flowed into the
Tennessee. From the locality of the ground, I
thought that if I could run the guards that
night, I could find my way to the river, and
thence back to my brigade. Lying down in
the tent, which was now my prison, I awaited
patiently the development of events, hoping the
while that the guards might soon be blest by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
the gentle embrace of slumber. I feigned sleep
and snored prodigiously.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="attempted">

  “I attempted to roll quietly away from the wretch, and might have succeeded,
  had I not encountered a guard, who thrust me with his bayonet,
  exclaiming, ‘Halt, dar!’”&mdash;Page&nbsp;39.
</div>
</div>

<p>“How sound that Yankee sleeps,” I heard
one of the guards remark.</p>

<p>About midnight a storm arose, and threatened
destruction to my tent, which was shortly
after blown over by an auspicious blast. It
instantly occurred to me that perchance there
was now an opportunity to escape, in the darkness
and noise of the storm. I attempted to
roll quietly away from the wreck, and might
have succeeded had I not encountered a guard,
who thrust me with his bayonet, exclaiming,
“Halt, dar!” I inquired as innocently as I
could, “You wouldn’t bayonet a sleeping man,
would you?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said he, apologetically, “I thought
you was awake.”</p>

<p>“Why! our tent has blown over, don’t you
see?”</p>

<p>The tent was soon put up, and I again safely
ensconced within its canvas walls. The next
day I was taken to Corinth, in a mule wagon,
and deposited in a rickety old warehouse.
Among the prisoners here were about twenty
slaves, some of them almost white, and all clad
in rags. Also in the company were ten or a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
dozen Tennesseeans, yclept “political prisoners,”
together with a few rebel soldiers.</p>

<p>Among the latter was a droll genius, who
answered to the name of “Calico Bill,” who
was under sentence of death for flogging his
captain. By some means he had procured an
old United States uniform, in which he donned
the dignity of a brigadier. In this garb he
would frequently assume the position of drill-master,
and the poor imbecile clay-eaters would
obey his orders with the menial servitude of
slaves. His conduct, while it was highly tyrannous,
was nevertheless amusing. He seemed
to have these ignorant soldiers completely
under his control, and I refer to this illustration
of slavish fear to “point the moral,” if not
“to adorn the tale.” It does not require very
profound penetration to ascertain the fact that
all through the South “the schoolmaster has
long been <i>abroad</i>.” I have sometimes thought
that if our present conflict resulted in no other
good, it would send light to many a benighted
spot, and, perchance,</p>

<div class="verse">Breathe the enlivening spirit, and fix</div>

</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Not a man in the prison with us could read!
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Bill practiced largely upon their credulity, and
when he desired a little “contraband” fun, he
would go to the window, which was always
crowded outside with “secesh,” and cry out:</p>

<p>“What will you have?”</p>

<p>“We want to see a Yankee,” they frequently
answered.</p>

<p>“Well, now you see <i>me</i>, and what do you
think of us?”</p>

<p>“What are you ’uns all down here fighting
we ’uns fur?”</p>

<p>Bill would reply: “For a hundred and sixty
acres of land and your negroes.”</p>

<p>“Calico Bill” was a genuine, shrewd and intelligent
Yankee, from the State of Maine. He
gave me a sketch of his history, in which I
learned that he was teaching in a private family
in Florida, when the war broke out, was pressed
into the Confederate service, and had quarreled
with his captain, who undertook to exercise
an authority over him, incompatible with
his native freedom. He said he would rather
meet his fate there than to die in the rebel
army. He said there were many Northern
men in their army, and that three-fourths of
them would vote for the old banner and Constitution,
if uninfluenced by their leaders. “But,”
he added, “you see how this fellow does” (referring
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
to the man he had been drilling); “and
there are thousands in their army just as ignorant
as he.”</p>

<p>When he went for a bucket of water, he
would call out, “Come on, about thirty or forty
of you infernal rebels, and go with me after
some water!”</p>

<p>In this way he would drill these guards, so
that those on the outside thought him a Federal,
while those on the inside believed him to be a
rebel officer.</p>

<p>In the rear of the warehouse was a counting-room;
and the entire prison could boast but
one bed, for which I, being the only officer, got
the preference. It consisted of an old coffee-sack,
filled with “body-guards,” and I reluctantly
accepted its use.</p>

<p>While standing near the door, two men came
in who were dressed in Federal uniforms. They
came to me and asked me if I was a Federal
officer.</p>

<p>“No,” said I, “not now; but I was a few
days ago. I am a prisoner now.”</p>

<p>In conversation with them, I ascertained that
they were northern men, but, being in the
South when the war broke out, were pressed,
like thousands of others, into the rebel army.
At the battle of Belmont, they deserted and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
joined the Fourth United States Cavalry, but
were afterwards taken prisoners at Shiloh, and
had been recognized as deserters. That day
they had had their trial before General Bragg,
who sentenced them to be shot on the following
Tuesday. I at once became interested in their
escape; and, forgetting my wounded and painful
hand, and the disagreeableness of my situation,
I pondered the fate of these men late into
that dismal night. On the evening of the same
day, a piece of file and a knife had been found
upon a shelf in the prison. We converted the
knife into a saw, and with this sawed off one of
the planks of the floor, thereby making an
aperture sufficient to permit a man to pass
through. By this means, these two men, in
company with “Calico Bill,” made their escape.
The hole I afterwards carefully concealed by
placing the bed over it. We had agreed with
the Tennesseeans that they should answer to
the names of the escaped prisoners when the
rebel officer came to the door to call the roll of
the inmates of the prison. This they continued
to do until Monday, at which time I was taken
to Columbus, Mississippi.</p>

<p>We had only one meal of victuals during the
forty-eight hours we remained in the prison,
and there were quite a number of men there
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
who did not get anything to eat. But for this
we had some apology, in the fact that the
armies were fighting very near us, and about
all these rebels could do was to lie and boast
about their success on the previous evening.
They brought us the news that our whole
army had been captured, that they had got
between our forces and the river, and had taken
twenty-seven thousand prisoners, and that the
remainder of the army had been driven to the
gunboats. So incredible and exaggerated were
their reports, that when they afterward informed
us of the capture of Prentiss and his
division, we placed no confidence whatever in
the story. On Sunday, at three o’clock, the
Texan Rangers came in greatly decimated,
themselves declaring that they had been cut to
pieces by our sharpshooters.</p>

<p class="chapsum">Taken to Columbus, Mississippi&mdash;Visit from the
Clergy&mdash;An Enthusiastic Mute&mdash;American
Aristocracy&mdash;Secession Lies&mdash;Political and Ecclesiastical
Prisoners&mdash;Reflections.</p>

<p class="noindent">On Monday morning, at ten o’clock, a part of
the prisoners left Corinth, for Columbus, Mississippi.
Wherever the cars stopped, the wildest
excitement prevailed.</p>

<p>“How goes the day?” was the constant inquiry.</p>

<p>We were exhibited as some of the trophies
of the battle. That the people were somewhat
divided, could easily be perceived from their
countenances. On the evening of the same
day, we arrived at Columbus, and there we
were placed under a heavy guard, in an old
warehouse; but the ex-Governor of Mississippi
came to the prison, and took us to the hotel,
where we enjoyed supper at his expense.
There the crowd gathered round us as though
we were some mammoth traveling menagerie,
while our hostess kept commenting earnestly
upon our handsome appearance, that, in spite
of my longitudinal neck and limbs, I began to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
suspect myself worthy the compliment. While
under guard here, I heard men declaring most
unequivocally their opposition to a Republican
form of government. Two ministers who
visited me&mdash;Rev. Doctor Tensley, of the First
Baptist Church, and Rev. Mr. Morris, of the
M. E. Church South&mdash;expressed but little confidence
in the Confederate cause. These gentlemen
invited me to their church on Sabbath,
but the force of circumstances compelled me to
decline the invitation. These circumstances
were, close confinement under a heavy guard;
and of this fact they were perfectly aware. I
was led from this to believe that their sympathy
was not genuine.</p>

<p>After the ministers left me, a deaf and dumb
man came to the door, and handed me a paper
which contained an article relative to the recent
battle of Shiloh. The account began in the
following self-gratulatory style: “Glory! glory!
glory! Victory! victory! I write from Yankee
paper.” The writer proceeded in his intense
and heated manner by saying, “Of all the victories
that have ever been on record, ours is the
most complete. Their repulse at Bull Run was
nothing to compare to our victory at Shiloh.
General Buell is killed, and General Grant
wounded and taken prisoner. Soon we will
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
prove too much for them, and they will be compelled
to let us alone. Our brave boys have
driven them to the river, and compelled them to
flee to their gunboats. The day is ours.”</p>

<p>The mute who had given me the paper was
so permeated with the prospect of rebel success,
that he favored hoisting the black flag, and in
this was sustained by a large number in that
neighborhood. As the news came slowly in,
the comments made on the state of affairs were
as various as they were amusing. Only through
the friendship and ingenuity of the slaves, who
were the <i>attaches</i> of the prison, were we privileged
to receive papers giving the account of the
recent fight. When they learned the true condition
of their army after the battle, and realized
that their boasted victory was a bloody defeat,
they became more charitable in their opinions.
I became well satisfied from the conversation I
overheard from rebel officers and visitors, during
my incarceration here, that a favorite doctrine
of Dixie is to adjust their “peculiar institution”
in such a way as to include the poor whites as
well as the colored people as chattel property.</p>

<p>I was here visited by two rebel captains
belonging to Bushrod Johnston’s staff, one of
whom was a lawyer from Virginia, named
McMoore. These men converged freely on the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
times. Both of them expressed themselves as
decidedly in favor of an American Aristocracy!
They argued, with as much earnestness and
ability as their vocabulary furnished words, the
imbecility of Republican government; and to
prove the immutability of their opinions, cited
to me the semi-idiotic and degraded “clay-eaters”
of the South, saying:</p>

<p>“What do these men know of civil institutions,
and what right have they to vote?”</p>

<p>Said I, “Gentlemen, is it possible that this is
the faith of your leaders?”</p>

<p>They replied emphatically in the affirmative.</p>

<p>“Then, sirs, we of the North have not been
mistaken on a subject which has been forcing
itself upon us as a fact, but which we were loth
to believe could harbor itself even in the basest
American heart. Since you are frank enough
to own it, certainly the world should know it,
and execrate it as it deserves.”</p>

<p>When I became acquainted with the motives
of these two representative men&mdash;how they despised
their poor, ignorant soldier-brethren,
armed and fighting to fasten fetters on themselves
and children for ever, I could but exclaim,
“Send out thy light and thy truth, O God! into
all the earth. Hasten the day when ignorance
and oppression shall vanish before the free gospel,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
and righteousness through all the land
prevail.”</p>

<p>From my prison windows I now had ample
leisure to study the countenances of all classes
of our rebellious enemies, from Brigadier Generals
down to the conscript “Sand-hillers.” All
faces were indicative of sadness. From what I
could see and overhear&mdash;the downcast eyes and
the conflicting stories&mdash;I was well satisfied that
they had been worsted at Shiloh. The officers
were given to wholesale exaggeration, their
falsifying tongues gliding from lie to lie with
the alacrity of a Baron Munchausen! These
prevarications forcibly reminded me of a negro
boy down South, who undertook to describe to
his master a storm.</p>

<p>“Why, massa, dare was de wonderfullest, de
tremendus’est most powerfulest win’ stohm dat
you ever heah. De win’ blowed so hard dat it
blowd de har&mdash;<i>de har</i>&mdash;all off one man’s head.
Ya’as, de har all off one man’s head! De har!”</p>

<p>“Now, Sam, you lying rascal, why didn’t the
wind blow <i>your</i> hair off?”</p>

<p>Just so the secession leaders falsify, and thus
they attempt to bolster up their improbable
Confederacy. The whole compact is a libelous
league with darkness!</p>

<p>Some of these pompous Southerners would
treat us with a kind of counterfeit courtesy,
which became to us even more disgusting than
outright abuse. The rebel army is made up of
a passive-minded, illiterate citizenship, officered
by slave-owners and negro-drivers. The maximum
of soldiers in a regiment is much smaller
than in the Federal army, and each company
has three Lieutenants. This gives the young
men of aristocratic families an opportunity to
wear shoulder-straps and lord it over the “poor
white trash,” which compose the rank and file.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
I learned from the prison guards, many of whom
would be loyal to the old Stars and Stripes if
they dared, that the mass of the Southern armies
have been forced by the most stringent and often
cruel measures to take up arms against the
United States Government.</p>

<p>At this place there were a number of political
prisoners, and a few prisoners of war. Once
we obtained leave to visit them. We were conducted
by a vigilant guard to their apartments
in an upper room of a very dilapidated building.
We found about one hundred and fifty Mississippi
citizens, such as were suspected of Union
sentiments, in a most loathsome situation.
Among them were three clergymen&mdash;one a
Presbyterian, one a “United Brother,” and the
other a Methodist. There was also a lawyer
from Kentucky, named Halleck, who had been
captured by Bishop General Polk. Halleck was
a subject of the ecclesiastical body over which
the Bishop ruled; but his loyalty to church did
not save him from arrest and trouble for want
of confidence in arch-treason. He had been
dragged from his bed by a band of ruffians who
tied his hands behind him, and forced him into
a filthy prison where he lay for seven months
in close confinement. He was finally permitted
to share a room with thirty-five or forty other
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Unionists. At one time they were so shamefully
neglected, that for three days they were unsupplied
with any food. To prevent absolute starvation,
they were obliged to beg the guards to
assist them in stealing a barrel of soap-grease,
which they devoured with a greedy relish! This
was in the midst of the boasted chivalry of
Columbus, Mississippi!</p>

<p>I should not forget to mention here the names
of the ex-Governor of the State, Mr. Whitefield,
and his son. They had human hearts, and extended
to us some degree of kindness and
sympathy. But these friendships were rare exceptions,
and all sufficient, if reported to rebel
officials, to call down vengeance on their heads.
The people, to avoid suspicion and imprisonment,
were compelled to practice all manner of
apparent cruelties. In this building we began
to feel the hateful oppressor’s power. We could
hardly believe that any portion of our once
united and happy country could be so soon, so
darkly blighted by accursed treason!</p>

<p>While looking on the old, rusty walls of my
prison-house, mocked and insulted by the jeering
outside multitudes, I had time and heart for
reflection. I thought of a familiar cottage amid
the hills of Ohio, at that very hour all fair and
free in the spring sunlight, the orchard blossoms,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
the opening flowers in garden and arbor,
the dewy meadow grass, and the thousand
charming scenes of my home! I thought of
wife and children there&mdash;how they would
wonder and fear at receiving no tidings from
the one they loved. I thought of God and his
cause&mdash;my country and her honor&mdash;my flag
and her insulted glory. I thought of the poor
Southern conscript, and the despised and fettered
slave of the cotton-field, and my soul was
stirred with mingled hope and compassion.
Thinking of my home, my friends, my country,
my wounds, my prison, I could but say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">  
<div class="verse">“Patience, my soul, the Saviour’s feet were worn;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">The Saviour’s heart and hands were weary too;</div>
<div class="verse">His garments stained, and travel-worn, and old,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">His vision blinded with a pitying dew.</div>
<div class="verse">Love thou the path of sorrow that he trod,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Toil on, and wait in patience for thy rest;</div>
<div class="verse">Oh! country that I love, we soon shall see</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Thy glorious cause triumphant, crowned and blest.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>While reflecting upon the inconsistency of secession,
and witnessing the persecutions heaped
upon those who were loyal to the flag and truth
of our fathers, I almost faltered in my religious
faith, for many of these leaders in treason
were professed Christians. But, through the
power of prayer, came a satisfying answer to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
my questioning fear. I felt that the Lord Omnipotent
was just&mdash;that his grace and gospel
were for the poor and the oppressed.</p>

<p>I remembered the day when the Saviour appeared
to me&mdash;when denser, darker prison-bands
were sundered. Then old things passed
away. Then came the strength to believe and
trust in a Higher Power&mdash;an Infinite Deliverer.
Remembering when the friendly voice had
spoken to my troubled heart, “Peace, be still,”
even in prison, and hated of men for Christ’s
and country’s sake, I could exclaim:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Faith, of our fathers, living still,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">In spite of dungeon, fire, and sword;</div>
<div class="verse">Oh! how our hearts beat high with joy</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Where’er we hear that glorious word!</div>
<div class="verse">Faith of our fathers! holy faith!</div>
<div class="verse">We will be true to thee till death!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Though a prisoner of war, a soldier can be a
Christian. He realizes in trial and trouble that
the Judge of all the earth does right.</p>

<p class="chapsum">The Wounded from Shiloh&mdash;Inquisitive
Negroes&mdash;An Abomination&mdash;A Striking
Contrast&mdash;Tom&mdash;Attempted Escape&mdash;An Ingenious
Darkey&mdash;Rebel Fare&mdash;The Irish Sergeant&mdash;Narrow
Escape&mdash;Mending Clothes and Getting News&mdash;Horrible Scenes in
Prison&mdash;A Discussion.</p>

<p class="noindent">During my imprisonment, many wounded
soldiers from Corinth, were brought to Columbus.
The leading men were painfully struck at
the loss of General Albert Sidney Johnson.
My prison life was romantic and instructive,
and I endeavored to make a partial atonement
for its deprivations. The negroes, whose business
it was to bring our victuals, and keep the
prison in some sort of order, were generally
inquisitive in their looks, and often in their
words. They wondered why so many white
men were confined and guarded. I was much
interested with two negro waiters, who came
daily to our room, one about twelve, and the
other about fifteen years of age. Said George,
the younger:</p>

<p>“Massa, when’s you gwine to take Memphis?”</p>

<p>“Why? George!” said one of our party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>“Kase my mother’s dar, and she’ll be free
when de Linkum sogers gits Memphis.”</p>

<p>“George,” said I, “what do you know about
freedom?”</p>

<p>“Why, Lor’ massa, I know’d if you’d whip
’em up dar, us colored folks ’ud all be free, an’
dat’s what makes dem rebels fight like de debel.
God bless you massa, I knows why. When de
war broke out, I was livin’ up in old Kentuck,
and dey say now we’se got to take dis here
nigger off, or else de Yankees will hab him. I
hoped and prayed dat de Yankees <i>would</i> git
me. God bless you, massa, <i>I knows</i>.”</p>

<p>From this time I began to be more than ever
interested in the negroes. I discovered a latent
talent in the despised race. I resolved to investigate
this new field of inquiry. The older
one of these waiters and myself, had afterward
many a friendly interview. He told me that he
had been reared in New Orleans. His father
was a white man, who often comforted his innocent
victim, by saying that her offspring should
be sent North to freedom. But when hostilities
began, he entered the army, forgetful alike
of his promises and his crimes. This outraged
woman was afterward hired to a planter, to
work in a cotton-field, while her son was sent
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
to Columbus, as a hotel waiter. Such, thought
I, are some of the barbarities of this horrid
system of enslavement.</p>

<p>About this time a Colonel was appointed as
commandant of this post, <i>vice</i> ex-Governor
Whitefield. Our boarding and location were
now changed, and we were placed in a back room
and fed on scanty rations of corn-bread <i>minus</i>
salt, and an indifferent supply of tainted meat,
which emitted a very disagreeable effluvia.</p>

<p>While in this condition, and lying on the bare
floor, a citizen entered and informed us that his
brother-in-law was then a prisoner in Columbus,
Ohio. He said he had been taken at Fort Donelson,
and that his wife had that day received a
letter from him, and that he was walking the
streets of Columbus, carrying his side-arms, and
boarding at the American House!</p>

<p>This statement aroused my indignation. I
never before felt so keenly my condition, and
when he attributed the lenity of our government
to cowardice and a disposition to admit the superiority
of southern claims and dignity, and
stigmatized us as “invaders” of their soil and
suffering justly as such, I could not restrain the
fiery wrath that burned within me. I have a
faint recollection of seeing the man hurrying in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
greedy haste from the prison, doubtless impelled
by the fear of something to come.</p>

<p>Again we were indebted to the kind services
of our ever-faithful and unwavering friends of
the race despised. One, who flourished under
the sobriquet of “Tom,” rendered us efficient
aid. Our object was to escape from the prison,
and for this purpose Tom brought us a rope and
chisel. With the chisel, I cut a hole through
the prison floor, but after laboring faithfully for
some time, I discovered that the room below
was filled to the ceiling with boxes and bales
containing commissary stores. I had arranged
with Tom, who had brought me a desiderated
map of Mississippi and Tennessee, to leave that
night, he occupying a station on the outside,
ready to aid me if necessary, and supplied with
sufficient provisions for my contemplated flight.</p>

<p>When I found myself foiled in my effort to
pass through the floor, I turned my attention to
the hearth of the room, which I took up, intending
to let myself down at that point, and make
my escape through a window below, which was
covered by a projecting roof. But just as I was
about to take away the key-stone of the hearth,
I heard the guard cry out, “<i>Corporal o’ de guard,
post number fo’</i>,” which arrested my attention,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
and moving toward the window, discovered in
the darkness of the night, that the rain was falling
in torrents. Again my ear caught the voice
of the guard, who, in his peculiar Southern intonations,
was addressing the corporal.</p>

<p>“I’s gittin’ all wet; put me undah dat ar
windah, dar.”</p>

<p>So the guard was stationed under the window
where I had contemplated making my exit,
and all my plans, for the nonce, were frustrated.</p>

<p>Early the next morning Tom came to the
door and said:</p>

<p>“<i>Why</i> you don’ didn’t come, massa?”</p>

<p>“Why, Tom, that room below is full of commissary
stores.”</p>

<p>“Why, massa, I don’ ought to have told you
dat, but I don’ didn’t know it.”</p>

<p>Tom came in, and I exhibited the hole in the
floor, and assured him that if the fact of its existence
were not concealed, I should be either
sent to jail or hung. He looked at it, and fruitful
as he was of expedients, soon devised a
remedy. He first tacked a piece of carpet over
the hole, and afterward, finding that it would
yield if trodden upon, constructed a rude seat
immediately above it.</p>

<p>This, and other manifestations of intellectual
and mechanical aptness, led me into a train of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
reflection concerning a race so decried and degraded.
I asked with Campbell&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Was man ordained the slave of man to toil,</div>
<div class="verse">Yoked with the brutes, and fettered to the soil;</div>
<div class="verse">Weighed in a tyrant’s balance with his gold?</div>
<div class="verse">No! Nature stamped us in a heavenly mould!</div>
<div class="verse">She bade no wretch his thankless labor urge,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor, trembling, take the pittance and the scourge.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>From this time I became deeply interested in
my African protege. He seemed keenly alive
to his condition. He told me in a conversation
that “the colored people were all heathens&mdash;they
knew nothing. I was talking,” he added,
“with massa and missus dis mornin’, and
missus asked me, ‘Tom what you tink of dem
Yankees?’</p>

<p>“‘Ah,’ says I, ‘missus, I don’ don’t like em at
all. Dey won’t have nothin’ to say to a nigger.’
Den missus said, ses she.</p>

<p>“‘Tom, don’t you know dese Yankees are
comin’ down har to confisticate all you cullod
people?’ Now, she tink I don’ don’t know
what ‘confisticate’ means; spec’ she tinks I tought
it was <i>to kill</i>. God bless you, massa, I knows
it is to <i>free de darkies</i>, and den dis pore nigger
have hoss and carriage, if I don’ can work and
pay for ’em. While I was talkin’ wid massa
and missus, I stood and shake all over. I tells
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
’em dat I is so ’feared dat dey would come dat
I don’t know what for to do. God bless you,
don’t you tink dey was fool enough to tink I
<i>was</i> afeerd. Ha! ha! ha!”</p>

<p>The hours wore heavily on in that dreary
prison-house. Tom brought our food in an old
trough, which had doubtless been employed in
feeding swine, and we were compelled to take in
food in genuine primitive style. In a short
time, we received intelligence that we were to
be removed to another apartment in the same
building, and I began to feel a degree of
uneasiness lest my effort to escape should be
discovered by the hole in the floor. Tom again
befriended me. He ascertained that a printing-press
was to be put up in the room the prisoners
had occupied, and while assisting in the work
succeeded in placing a portion of the stationary
materials in such a manner as to effectually
secrete the aperture.</p>

<p>As I have already intimated, our supply of
food grew “smaller by degrees and horribly
less.” Our gastronomic propensities were however,
occasionally regaled by some delicacies (?)
smuggled in to us by Tom and his brother Pete.
We did not care then to inquire whether they
obtained them honestly or not, but the probability
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
is that they were appropriated from their
master’s larder.</p>

<p>One of our chief annoyances in this prison
was in the person of a diminutive, pompous,
and arrogant Irishman named Mackey, who
seemed to rejoice in the title of “sergeant,”
which he took great care to frequently ventilate
in the presence of the prisoners. He was an
orderly of the provost marshal, and the fellow,
clothed with a little brief authority, seemed to
be impressed with the sole idea that tyranny
was the only attribute of one so exalted. Once,
when he came into my quarters, I asked him
what object he could have in the rebel army,
and what profit he expected to derive from the
establishment of a confederacy?</p>

<p>“Enough, be jabers,” he replied. “You
Yankees want to free our nagers, be sure, and
we’re all ferninst that here, and we won’t submit
at all, at all.”</p>

<p>“How many negroes have <i>you</i>, Mr. Mackey,”
I asked.</p>

<p>“Why, sure, and be jabers, and I haven’t a
nager in the world.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, what interest then can you have
in this war?”</p>

<p>“Och, and be sure, a poor tool of an Irishman
can hardly git a wee jab of work now,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
and if these divels were free, we’d have to go
beggin’ foriver.”</p>

<p>So, selfishness, in the guise of slavery and
pride, forms the substratum of the so-called
Southern Confederacy.</p>

<p>On further conversation with the sergeant, I
learned that he had really no interest in the
cause of the South, that he was not in the army
from choice, but as a means of obtaining a
livelihood, and that he bitterly cursed rebellion
in his heart as the prolific parent of untold
evils.</p>

<p>Our new room fronted the hotel, and from
some of the officers we obtained permission to
stand upon the balcony of the prison during
a part of each evening. On one occasion we
were ordered back by the guards. I hesitated
a moment; but in that moment a guard leveled
his piece and drew the trigger. Fortunately
for me the gun missed fire, but at the same
moment another guard fired, and killed a deaf
man who had thrust his head from an upper
window. Realizing the danger to which I was
exposed, I instantly withdrew.</p>

<p>On the same evening, I noticed an unusual
excitement among the rebel officials. To ascertain
its cause I again had recourse to Tom. He
requested me to tear a hole in my coat, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
then order him, in the presence of the guards,
to take it to some tailor for repairs. He insisted
that I should speak angrily to him, for
such a course would more effectually deceive
the guards. I did as he had directed, and he demurred,
declaring that he wished dem “Yankees
would mend dar own close.” The guards in a
peremptory tone commanded him to get the
coat, and have it repaired forthwith. This was
what Tom desired; and with many protestations
of hatred toward the whole Yankee race,
he, with great apparent reluctance, carried the
garment from the prison.</p>

<p>In a short time he returned, seemingly in the
same mood, and with well-feigned indignation,
handed over the coat. On examination I found
a newspaper in one of the pockets which contained
an account of the evacuation of Corinth,
the surrender of Island No. 10, and the
bombardment of Fort Pillow, New Orleans,
and other important information of which we
had previously known nothing! This little
artifice and its successful management, while it
furnished me with very cheering intelligence,
also gave me an elevated opinion of Tom’s
native talents.</p>

<p>Other prisoners continued to arrive, many of
whom had been wounded in the battle of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
Shiloh, and new quarters were prepared for
them. They were incarcerated in an old stone
building not far from our prison, and although
wounded and almost famished, were compelled
to lie upon the hard floor, their wounds undressed,
and their physical wants unattended
to. I obtained permission to visit them,
and as I entered the house my eyes were
pained by a sight that beggars description.
Eighteen prisoners, “crushed by pain and
smart,” occupied the room. There were men
in that room who had been wounded for two
weeks, and who, during that whole time, had
not received the slightest attention. The result
had been that their wounds were tainted with
putrid flesh, and alive with crawling maggots!
I obtained a list of their names at the time, but,
as the reader will hereafter learn, was subsequently
compelled to burn it. The only
apology the rebel authorities could offer for
this brutal neglect was that they were too
busily employed in attending to the wants of
their own to look to the welfare of others.</p>

<p>Many of the men died, some from their
wounds, and others from disease. The sad and
sickening scenes of prison life daily harrowed
up the soul’s keener susceptibilities, and one
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
by one they yielded up their lives a sacrifice
for liberty.</p>

<p>On one occasion, I heard the guards engaged
in an animated discussion concerning their participation
in the war. One of them remarked:</p>

<p>“Bill, you and I are both poor men, and
what in the name of God are we fighting for?”</p>

<p>“Why, Tom, you haven’t turned traitor to
the Confederacy, have you?”</p>

<p>“No,” said he, “I can’t say that I have, but
I’d like mighty well to know what profit this
whole thing will be to us poor people. I have
a family, you know; and I have been forced to
leave them, and here I am. You know how
everything hes riz. There’s flour now, and
you can’t git a barrel for less nor forty dollars,
and pork is fifty dollars a hundred, and there
aint a bit of salt to be got for love nor money.
Now, I’d jist like to know what a man’s family
is going to do under such circumstances?”</p>

<p>Bill answered by saying:</p>

<p>“This war aint a-going to last long. How’ll
them fellers do without cotton. They’ll have
to give in afore two months, for all their manufactures
have stopped now.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe a word of that ’ere stuff.
It’s all gammon, I tell you. They can do
without <i>us</i> a great deal better nor we can do
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
without <i>them</i>. They’ve got the whole world to
resort to, and can git their supplies anywhere
they please.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know that; but then they haint got
anything other nations want. It was <i>our</i> cotton
what brought all the gold and silver into the
country.”</p>

<p>“There’s that old song again. Why, they’ve
got the best perducing land in the world. And
their corn and cattle aint to be sneezed at the
world over.”</p>

<p>“Well, that may all be true,” rejoined the
other, “but they can’t whip us.”</p>

<p>“Well, suppose we whip them, what will
be gained?”</p>

<p>“Why, we’ll stop the ’tarnal thieves from
stealing our niggers.”</p>

<p>“Now that’s a grand mistake. Don’t you see
every nigger in the South will break right for
the North, for there won’t be no Fugitive Slave
Law then. And then you know what a dreadful
time we had not long ago up Lowndes
county with the niggers, for this here country’s
got twice as many niggers as whites.”</p>

<p>At this an angry dispute arose between them,
one declaring the other an abominable Yankee,
and the other is stoutly denying it. Oaths
were freely bandied, and the loyal Southerner
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
threatened to call the corporal of the guard,
and have the other arrested. The latter in the
mean time continued to protest that he had said
nothing detrimental to Southern interests.</p>

<p>“Well, how did you know,” said the rabid
secessionist, “about the cattle and corn in New
York, if you had never lived there?”</p>

<p>“But I have been there, though I never lived
in that region.”</p>

<p>“Well, if that’s the case,” responded his
antagonist, “you had better keep mighty quiet
about it, or we’ll treat you like we did John
Peterson, that miserable Yankee that we hung
last week to a pine tree.”</p>

<p>Just then the relief-guard came, and the conversation
ceased. I noted down at the time the
dialogue as it occurred, gave the manuscript
subsequently to my friend Captain Steadman,
who, in connection with other papers, as the
reader will presently learn, carried it to Washington
city, where I received it from him.</p>

<p>From all this, which was spoken in a most
angry and boisterous manner, and while I held
my ear to the key-hole of the prison-door, I
learned what excessive antipathy the Southern
people, as a mass, entertain towards persons of
Northern birth. As the reader follows me
through this book, other evidences of Southern
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
ignorance, malice, and inhumanity will arise,
all of which I witnessed or experienced, and all
of which are related with no spirit of hatred,
but as an “ower true tale.” I do not relate
these facts in the spirit of a politician, nor for
political purposes; for the nativity, education,
and political antecedents of myself and of the
entire family from which I sprung, have developed
a warm support of Democratic principles.
To these I yet ardently adhere, though
positively and absolutely repudiating that form
thereof which in the slightest degree affiliates
with treason or oppression.</p>

<p class="noindent">Our condition now became so painful and
distressing, that, as a last resort, we determined
to petition the authorities for a redress of our
grievances. We had neither beds nor blankets,
and the allowance of rations doled out to us
was insufficient to sustain life. A lieutenant in
the Confederate service, a poor, illiterate fellow,
not possessed of education sufficient to call the
muster-roll correctly, entered the prison and
threatened to place Major Crockett&mdash;of whom
we have spoken before&mdash;in irons, simply because
he had referred, in the Lieutenant’s presence,
in no very favorable terms, to the character
of our treatment. We had made application
personally to Colonel McClain, then commandant
of the post, and who, we learned, was a
professed Christian. We were careful to appeal
to his Christianity as a means of awakening an
interest in our behalf. His reply was as follows:</p>

<p>“You invaders! you abolitionists! you that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
are <i>stealing</i> our property! <i>you</i> talk about
Christianity! You should be the last men to
utter a word on that subject.”</p>

<p>A lieutenant in our ranks, named Herbert,
answered him by saying:</p>

<p>“If your so-called Southern Confederacy
cannot furnish us with enough to eat, just inform
us and we will acquaint our government
of the fact.”</p>

<p>This seemed to irritate the doughty Colonel,
and he replied very fiercely:</p>

<p>“I’ll let you know that we have a government
strong enough to hold <i>you</i>. You will
have to go into close confinement.”</p>

<p>In a short time four men with loaded guns
entered, and took Lieutenant Herbert from the
prison. What was to be his fate we knew not,
but in five days he returned, his appearance
indicating that he had been exposed to severe
treatment. He told me that he was taken to
the old county jail, was there incarcerated in a
damp, filthy, and bedless cell, swarming with
odious vermin, and from which a negro had
recently been taken to be executed. This
barbarous outrage was inflicted for the sole
purpose, in the language of his tormentor, “of
letting him know that there was a Southern
Confederacy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>The sick and wounded prisoners in the room
above us were suffering intensely, and we were
not allowed the privilege of visiting them. In
order to hold any communication at all with
the inmates above, we were compelled to resort
to an expedient which answered our purpose
for the time. We obtained a small wire, and
by letting it down from the upper window
to the one below, and attaching a written
communication to it, opened up a kind of
telegraphic connection between the two departments
of the prison. In this way we were
daily informed of the transactions of our friends
above.</p>

<p>We were now about to leave the prison, and
we quitted it, feeling with Bishop King, that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“A prison is in all things like a grave,</div>
<div class="verse">Where we no better privileges have</div>
<div class="verse">Than dead men; nor so good.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>We were next taken to Mobile, Alabama.
On our way thither, I conversed with a number
of Southrons, among whom was an insignificant
personage from South Carolina. He complained
because their officers were not allowed to have
their servants with them. He called it one of
the most inhuman deprivations imaginable!</p>

<p>“Sir,” said I, “we have been treated like
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
beasts and half-starved here on your southern
soil; what do you think of that?”</p>

<p>“O,” he replied, “that’s all right enough for
you ’uns; but <i>we</i> belong to the first families of
South Carolina!”</p>

<p>“Your logic is vain, sir, for we of the free
North recognize no officer in the army as made
of better stuff than the least drummer-boy in
the service. Your ‘first families’ were the prime
movers in this rebellion, being the degenerate
descendants of bankrupt royalists and luckless
adventurers.” The truth cut him severely, and
he began to curse the “mudsills” of the North,
ridiculing that pure democracy which lifts up
the poor and levels down the rich. When I
referred to our free schools and our general information
as a people, he raved like a madman.
His ignorance boiled over in froth and fury,
only to emphasize the corrupting effects of the
bastard aristocracy of the South.</p>

<p>We arrived in Mobile on Sabbath morning,
the 26th of May. Here, too, we could detect
an undercurrent of Union sentiment in the humane
treatment we received. I knew full well,
however, the odium in which the Mobilians held
all who opposed human bondage as legalized in
the Confederacy. I felt that we were indeed
among enemies and barbarians. We were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
driven like yoked bondmen to the heart of the
city, and there halted in the crowded streets for
about two hours and a half beneath a sweltering
Alabama sun, after which we were thrust into
the negro sale stables. Of course we were fatigued
and sickened by such outrageous treatment,
but we bore it all as patiently as grace
would allow. As we entered these human chattel
stalls where many poor hearts had sorrowed
before, we noticed this inscription over our stable
door.</p>

<p class="center">
“<span class="smcap">NEGROES FOR SAIL AND GOOD FEALD HANDS.</span>”
</p>

<p>During our stay in this place there was quite
a stir among the rebels. The astounding fact
was revealed that the mules slain at Shiloh had
been barreled up and forwarded to Mobile to
feed Yankee prisoners! When this abomination
was made known to the commandant, he
immediately ordered the mule-beef to be thrown
into the river; and in order to redeem his government
from the merited contempt of the civilized
world, he published the facts in the Mobile
papers. A copy of a daily paper containing
the information was furnished us by a negro,
and we had the satisfaction of reading the history
of our rations!</p>

<p>The commandant’s motives in publishing this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
barbarity were not appreciated by the chivalrous
(?) authorities, and he was himself arrested
and imprisoned for an act that even cannibals
might blush to condemn.</p>

<p>The negroes, who were shrewder and more
manly than their masters, were our faithful
friends and news-bearers. They all understood
how to furnish us papers in the manner described
in a previous chapter. The results of
the mule-beef investigation plainly proved that
the whole transaction was sanctioned by the
Government. It was not an individual speculation
by an unprincipled army contractor, but
an official outrage, perpetrated by the chivalrous
Confederacy!</p>

<p>From Mobile we were taken to Selma, from
thence to Tuscaloosa, and from thence to Montgomery.
Here we were placed in the penitentiary
over night, until arrangements could be
made for our accommodation in the military
prison. Here we shared the fare of criminals,
which proved to be the best I ever received in
Dixie. As to the truthfulness of the report that
the Confederacy had liberated their felons as
soldiers, I am not prepared to speak. But while
I was in the Montgomery penitentiary, during
the brief space of thirty hours, two inmates were
released and paid eight hundred dollars each to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
enter the service as substitutes. This I witnessed.
The keeper of the prison informed me,
on inquiring the nature of their crimes, that
they were murderers. From reliable sources I
learned that many criminals, from different
southern prisons, were received into the army
as soldiers. The two I saw were desperate-looking
men.</p>

<p>While here I was deeply impressed at seeing
a negro in an adjoining cell under condemnation
of death. In order to frighten him to make
such confessions as his accusers desired, the
rope with which he was to be suspended from
the gallows, was put in the cell with the culprit.
I asked the keeper the nature of the man’s offence,
and was told that he was sentenced to die
for stealing a watch.</p>

<p>“What! are you going to hang a man for
stealing a watch?”</p>

<p>“O, yes,” said my informant, “we must be
severe with these niggers, or we couldn’t live for
them.”</p>

<p>“But he is a valuable-looking piece of property.”</p>

<p>“True, sir, but the State is obligated to pay
one-half his value to the master, and he was appraised
at sixteen hundred dollars,&mdash;so you see
only one-half the loss will fall upon his master.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>All this was spoken with that serious business
air which showed a real sympathy with the
slaveholder who was about to suffer the loss of
eight hundred dollars!</p>

<p>On account of my crippled hand and general
debility, I was privileged to walk about the hall.
There I could see the doomed man who was so
soon to suffer the ignominious death of the scaffold.
The keeper’s sympathy was altogether
with the owner of the negro; but he congratulated
himself in the master’s behalf by saying
that, since the beginning of the war, negroes
were poor sale, and that for the owner of this
condemned one to get half his appraised value
would be very consoling in the hour of trouble!
One circumstance in connection with this incident
gladdened my heart. On one occasion I
overheard two men conversing with the negro
in his cell. They were godly men, and had
come to offer the sympathy of supplication in
prayer. One of these visitors was gifted in a
special manner. His pleadings before the court
of heaven in behalf of his unfortunate fellow-man,
were touchingly eloquent. He sang and
prayed alternately, and with tearful eyes and
tender tones, pointed the criminal to the Saviour
who blessed the dying thief on Calvary. But
all his instructions and persuasions seemed alike
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
in vain. The stoic prisoner remained hard-hearted
and unmoved.</p>

<p>I asked and obtained permission from the
keeper to speak a few words to the man so soon
to die. The conditions on which I obtained the
favor were that my instructions should be given
in the keeper’s presence.</p>

<p>Looking through the iron bars at my sinful
but unfortunate auditor, I said,</p>

<p>“Do you believe that Christ died for all?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, massa,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Well, you know something about the Bible,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>“No, massa.”</p>

<p>“Have you never heard the Gospel preached?”</p>

<p>“Yes, massa, I used to hear old parson Cooper
preach, and I guess dat was what he preached
about.”</p>

<p>“Can you read?”</p>

<p>“No, massa.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever pray?”</p>

<p>“No, massa. I’se heard folks a-prayin’. My
massa never prayed like dis nigga,”&mdash;referring
to the visitor who had been praying with him
in the cell.</p>

<p>“Well, my dear fellow, you know you have
to die, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, massa.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>“What do you think will become of you
when you die?”</p>

<p>“I dun know, massa.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever talk with white people on
this subject?”</p>

<p>“No, massa.”</p>

<p>Here our conversation was interrupted by
the keeper, who told me I must return to my
cell. I had no further opportunity to converse
with the poor negro prisoner. My thoughts
troubled me. I reflected on the destiny of
these immortal beings, thus oppressed in body
and soul by their tyrant masters. What a
fearful weight of responsibility rests <i>somewhere</i>!
Who shall give account in the great day for
the ignorance of the four millions of slaves,
going up to judgment from a land of boasted
light and knowledge? This slave was a representative
man. Although he knew little about
secular matters, he had opportunity to learn
even less of religion!</p>

<p>But despite all the efforts to keep the slaves
in ignorance, both by legal enactments and
tyrannical vigilance, very many of them gained
a surprising fund of information. What an
accursed system of wrong is that which locks
the Bible from the homes and hearts of the
poor! May the uttermost overthrow come upon
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
an institution that prohibits the education of
any class or color of God’s children!</p>

<p>The next day, before leaving the prison, I
asked permission to visit the colored convict
once more, but the privilege was not granted.
That very day a dark man was hung, and a
darker crime registered in the book of Judgment-day
accounts, the penalty of which will
by-and-by rest upon the head of the guilty perpetrators.</p>

<p class="chapsum">A New Prison&mdash;Murder of Lieutenant
Bliss&mdash;In Irons&mdash;Yankee Ingenuity&mdash;Rebel
Ignorance&mdash;Parson Rogers&mdash;Faithful Servants&mdash;Bold and
Successful Escape of Prisoners&mdash;Captain Troy&mdash;A Blindfold
Journey&mdash;A Traitor.</p>

<p class="noindent">We were now conducted to our new quarters in the
military prison, a description of which I will attempt. The side walls
were of brick, twenty inches in thickness, and thirteen feet high. The
ends were closed by massive ironclad wooden gates, extending the whole
width of the prison. The room was about two hundred feet long, and forty
in width. It was used formerly as a cotton depot. There was on either
side a narrow shed-roof, sloping inward, extending two-thirds of the
entire length of the building. Beneath this shelter were six hundred
soldiers, and about one hundred and fifty political prisoners.</p>

<p>Near this prison, Lieutenant Bliss, of Illinois,
one of the noblest and truest men I ever knew,
and a minister of the gospel, was murdered.
The circumstances of this cruel outrage are as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
follows: One beautiful morning in May, the
Lieutenant, being somewhat indisposed, and
desiring to breathe the fresh and fragrant air
without our prison walls, asked permission of
the Captain of the Guard, to go to an adjacent
house and get his canteen filled with fresh milk.
With considerable reluctance the privilege was
granted, and the Lieutenant and myself were
allowed to go on our errand, under a guard of
four armed men. Upon our arrival at the
house, Bliss handed his canteen through the
window, where a lady received it, and in accordance
with his request, filled it with milk, and
passed it back to him. At this moment, one
of the guards muttered some undistinguishable
order, which I was unable to understand,
although I was nearer the guard than Bliss.
The command, whatever it was, of course could
not be obeyed; but the guard instantly raised
his gun. Bliss saw it, and remarked pleasantly,
though a little excited:</p>

<p>“You are not going to shoot me, are you?”</p>

<p>No sooner were his words uttered, than the
gun was fired and the bullet pierced the heart
of my gallant comrade. His last words were,
“Brother, I’m shot!” I stood amazed and
dumb with indignation over the bleeding corpse
of my faithful companion, the three remaining
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
loaded guns pointed at me. From this scene of
murder I was forced back to the prison. I felt
it my duty to report this inhuman act to the
commandant, and ask redress, by having the
reckless guard punished. What was my astonishment
and indignation to learn, afterward,
that that very guard, for that very act, was
granted thirty days’ furlough as a reward. The
only apology offered was, that possibly the
guard misunderstood his instructions! I ventured
to tell the commandant, Captain Troy,
my opinion of such conduct, and to his face
called the outrage by its proper name, a bloody
murder, committed under his guilty authority.
As I might have expected, this plain language
brought down his vengeful wrath, and he replied:</p>

<p>“I will put you in irons, sir.”</p>

<p>I could but reply, thinking of my dear, lost
comrade:</p>

<p>“I am in your power, sir, irons or no irons;
but you murdered my sick friend, and are guilty
of shedding his blood!”</p>

<p>For my impertinence, I was handcuffed and
made to suffer the cruel spite of my hateful enemies.</p>

<p>These things occurred in the city of Montgomery,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Alabama, among the chivalry of the
South.</p>

<p>We often suffered for water in this cotton-shed
prison. Some of our boys resolved to dig a
well within the walls. In digging, they came to
a stratum of potters’ clay, by which, after the
well was completed, they passed many a leisure
hour in manufacturing little wares, such as pipes,
rings, cups, &amp;c., all of which found a ready sale
among the rebels, and commanded a fair price
in Confederate shinplasters. The ingenuity of
our Yankee boys was a constant marvel to the
stupid Southrons. We received sufficient pocket
money by our manufactures to furnish us with
many little conveniences and comforts. One of
our comrades, who had formerly been an engraver,
and who had no conscientious scruples
about using the rebel currency to the best advantage,
was very skilful in changing five cent
scrip to fifties, and many of the fives that
were <i>passed in</i> for our wares, <i>passed out</i> fifties
for gingerbread!</p>

<p>One day quite a commotion prevailed among
the rebel peddlers in our prison. A gaunt, gawking
fellow had received one of these changed
bills, but was not quite satisfied of its genuineness.
A motley crowd were huddled around
him trying to unravel the mystery. I was called
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
by the holder of the bill to explain. Said the
puzzled critic, holding out the suspected paper
and pointing to the redundant cipher at the right
of the five:</p>

<p>“Look here, Capt’n, at this tarnal round
thing here. This thing ortn’t fur to be here.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” said I, “I can’t help it; why did
you put it there?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t put it thar, nuther. I got it uv
that thar feller,” said he, pointing to a bright-eyed
soldier about seventeen years of age, who
sat looking on with apparent indifference, but
who was greatly enjoying the confusion of the
ignorant butternut, who had just sense enough
to know that something was wrong, but no ingenuity
to detect the imposition. I do not justify
this money-making trick, but, under the
circumstances, its sinfulness is somewhat diminished.</p>

<p>We were then more than a thousand miles
from home, surrounded by a bloodthirsty and
infuriated mob, robbers of our government, and
oppressors of our fellow-men. We were dragged
to that prison half-starved and moneyless. Our
rations consisted of a bit of spoiled beef not
larger than your two fingers, a small slice of
coarse corn-bread without salt, and this only
twice a day. Whatever more than this we
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
received, we were compelled to buy at fabulous
prices. While in Montgomery I became acquainted
with a clergyman named Rogers, a
member of the Methodist Church South, who
had spent many years in the itineracy, and who
was a chaplain in the Mexican war. Mr. Rogers
was a man of fine talent, vast experience, and
apparently of great piety. He had been an
intimate friend, in other years, of Parson Brownlow,
which circumstance made his acquaintance
an interesting one to me. He had been arrested,
and, without a trial hurried from his motherless
children to this gloomy prison. The old divine
gave me an account of some of his sufferings.
He had been frequently imprisoned for his loyal
sentiments; and in a few instances made hair-breadth
escapes from lynching. While he was
in prison he preached for us. The gospel sound
was glorious to hear, even beneath the cloud
that rested upon us. Though in bonds, we
could listen to the voice of truth&mdash;the truth
that makes us free indeed.</p>

<p>I was here again amused and benefited by
the ingeniousness of the colored people, of
whom so many wiseacres are constantly seeking
to prove a natural imbecility. Very often these
shrewd observers would anticipate our wants,
and bring us such articles as we really most
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
desired. Sometimes an apparently careless
lounger would lean himself against our prison-gates,
as if to rest himself, and while facing
the guards, his skilful fingers would slip a file
or a knife through some small aperture to an
inside Yankee. These implements were always
in demand for the purpose of making rings
and trinkets from refuse beef bones. And in
case of a contemplated escape from prison,
such helps as these are invaluable. It was a
constant perplexity to the “Clay-eaters,” to see
the negroes so well posted on war matters.
Though the unhappy race have been downtrodden
and abused to an outrageous extent,
which nothing short of eternity will adequately
punish, yet they are more intellectual and
virtuous than the majority of the whites in
Secessia. With Anthony Benezett, the philanthrophic
Quaker, I sincerely declare that I
have found among the negroes as great a
variety of talent as among a like number of
whites; and I am bold to assert that the notion
entertained by some, that they are inferior in
their capacities, is a vulgar prejudice, founded
on the pride or ignorance of their lordly
masters, who have kept their slaves at such a
distance as to be unable to form a right judgment
of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>While we lay in this old cotton-shed, thirteen
of the prisoners conceived and executed a plan
of escape. They succeeded in scaling the walls,
and wandered about the country for some time;
but being unacquainted with the geographical
features of the locality, were all subsequently
recaptured, and again brought to the prison.
For this attempted escape, several were shot,
and others were loaded with huge chains. In
the midst of this severe punishment they never
once repined, but looked forward with ardent
hope to a period when they might again be
permitted to defend the ensign of liberty they
so dearly cherished. Many who had previously
been “conservative” in their views of the peculiar
institution, now realized a modification
of their sentiments, while the universal conviction
seemed to be that this system of human
bondage had been the parent source of all our
national dissensions.</p>

<p>Captain Troy seemed to derive special delight
in practising almost every species of deception
upon the defenceless prisoners. He frequently
cheered us with assurances that our imprisonment
would soon terminate, and that we would
be on our way homeward in a short time. All
these hopes would as quickly give place to
saddening disappointments, for in none of his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
declarations was there the least shadow of truth!
One day he entered and told us that we had
been exchanged, and ordered us to immediately
prepare for our departure. Then we realized
“how deep a gloom one beam of hope enlightens,”
and in our fancy, already treading
the soil of liberty, lost no time in making all
necessary preparations to quit the land of
chains and cruelty. Nor had we much to prepare&mdash;a
few moments only, and we stood ready
for our exodus. The minutes dragged lazily
on that were to introduce us to freedom; but
what was our unspeakable vexation and chagrin
to learn that we had been the victims of a
cruel hoax, perpetrated through sheer diabolism.</p>

<p>One bright and beautiful summer morning,
however, legitimate orders came for our instantaneous
departure, and, as before, we were soon
ready. At eleven o’clock, we stepped aboard
the cars, and were soon whirled from this
Sodomic city to await the gradual developments
of our destiny unknown. Two hundred
and fifty miles brought us to the city of Columbus,
Georgia, on the Chattahoochee river. The
crowd that met us here was composed of
remarkably coarse material, and as far as we
could perceive, seamed to be an average of the
staple human product in that locality. They
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
saluted us with such epithets as “blue-bellied
Yankees,” “dirty nigger-thieves,” &amp;c., exhausting
the entire slave-pen vocabulary, the reigning
vernacular.</p>

<p>I regret that I am compelled to record the
defection of one of our party, whom we had
supposed to be in hearty sympathy with us,
but, who, as the sequel will show, was co-operating
with the enemy. Our first suspicions
were aroused by the tender regard shown him
by the rebel officials and ladies; but when we
came to Columbus, his designs and character
became more and more apparent. Of him we
shall hereafter speak more at length.</p>

<p>The city in which we had temporarily halted
quartered a large force of rebel soldiers, the
majority of them better clad than any we had
yet met. The place itself, extending one mile
and a quarter in the direction of the river, and
about half a mile toward the interior, and
numbering a population of nearly nine thousand,
was a beautiful one. I observed a
number of unfinished buildings, erected most
probably before the war, but now standing
exposed and weather-beaten, with no roofs to
protect them from the sun and rain. The
people here seemed determined to prolong the
war to the last, confident of ultimate success.</p>

<p class="noindent">We were next taken to Macon, Georgia. Traveling

almost too intolerable to be borne.</p>

<p>On board the train, however, there was one
companionable and intelligent gentleman. I
regret that I cannot record his name, for he
was a worthy man, and a lover of his country.
He related to me many strange inconsistencies
of rebeldom. Said he:</p>

<p>“I am here in the army. I was a Douglas
Democrat, and opposed this war until my life
was threatened. My only alternative was to
become a soldier. You may think your case
a hard one, sir, but I would readily exchange
with you, for then I should not be compelled to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
fire upon any who rallied beneath the stars and
stripes. I was in the Mexican war, and there
followed the dear old flag until it floated
proudly over the metropolis of the enemy.”</p>

<p>He also informed me that he had a family
dependent upon him for a livelihood, and complained
of a government that paid eleven dollars
a month to soldiers, and allowed fifty dollars
per barrel to be exacted for flour, and all other
necessaries in proportion. Pointing to his
coarse shoes, he said:</p>

<p>“These cost me eleven dollars; this flimsy
clothing I wear cost ten dollars a yard! Once
times were good and we were content and
happy; but now my family is suffering, and I
know not my own fate. I know not whether
you are a Christian or not; but, sir, my hope is
in the Lord. He knows my heart; and although
I am compelled to do what I believe to be
wrong, I feel that God will forgive me for my
family’s sake.”</p>

<p>He was a member of the Methodist Church
South, an uneducated man, but honest and humble.
He remarked that, if our conversation
were overheard, we would both be in danger of
immediate death.</p>

<p>The morning light appeared at last, and we
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
were passing through a level, boggy country,
very thinly inhabited.</p>

<p>Soon after dawn, the long, shrill scream of
the locomotive announced that we were approaching
a place of some note. In a few minutes
we were in Macon depot; but of our destiny
or doom we knew nothing. At this time
there were about six hundred of us. Not until
ten o’clock were we permitted to move,
hungry and hampered as we were. Then we
were taken from the cars, and for the first time
set our feet on the traitor-cursed soil of Bibb
county, Georgia. In a short time we were
driven, like a herd of mules, to the fair-ground,
an area of three acres, surrounded by a picket-fence.
Within were several large, rough,
wooden buildings thrown together for the purpose
of holding Yankee prisoners.</p>

<p>It was now the 29th of May, and the noonday
heat was intense. They kept us sweltering
in the broiling sun for more than two hours,
and our sufferings were excessive. Suddenly
the attention of the crowd was attracted by a
pompous-looking individual, who mounted a
stump in the enclosure, and began, with violent
gesticulations, to harangue the prisoners.</p>

<p>The substance of this speech is herewith appended,
though I confess my inability to transmit
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
it in the <i>patois</i> in which it was spoken. It
is reported to serve as a specimen of the average
of Southern logic and oratory, such as
often harried our unwilling ears:</p>

<p>“Prisoners, you have been committed to my
charge, and you know that you are invaders of
our soil. You have been stealing our property,
and running them off to Canada and other
places. And when we appealed to you to deliver
up our slaves, you passed liberty bills
in your States, nullifying a law that had been
passed by the legislature, declaring that you
would not regard the Fugitive Slave Law. We,
in assuming the position we now do, are acting
as a safeguard to our slaves, and protecting
them as our property&mdash;property to which we
have the right guaranteed to us by God himself,
when he said, ‘Servants, be obedient unto
your masters.’ But you of the North have
violated the Word of God, and the Constitution
of the once United States. When we asked to
secede from you, giving you all your rights,
and demanding only our own, your government
waged an unholy war against us&mdash;have carried
it into our country with all its carnage, destruction,
and bloodshed. The God of battles is
turning all things in our favor, and we are
driving your army from our soil&mdash;taking your
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
men prisoners, which is your own sad experience.
Now, prisoners, you are in my charge,
and I am sure you cannot expect me to treat
you only as invaders of our soil, and murderers
of our countrymen. Notwithstanding all this,
I shall try to do the best for you, as poor unfortunate
prisoners, that the conscience of a
brave and gallant officer would allow him.
While you obey my orders strictly, you shall
not suffer. But if you disobey them, you must
expect to take the consequences.”</p>

<p>After this address, embodying so much profundity
and wisdom, we were surrounded by a
heavy guard, and taken within the guard-lines
located on the grounds referred to.</p>

<p>What a dreary spot for our abode, to be endured
we knew not how long! A gloomy, dismal
pen was to be our habitation. The only
shade afforded us was that of a few straggling
pine-trees, beneath which we sat at times,
brooding over our forlorn and desolate situation.
Oh! how wearily passed the days! how
sadly the nights! How much did our thoughts
revert to the “loved ones at home,” and how
in imagination did we realize the loneliness of
their sorrowing hearts!</p>

<p>Mr. Rogers&mdash;before spoken of&mdash;came and
informed me that a group of men standing at a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
little distance were from Tennessee and Mississippi,
with several of whom he was well acquainted,
and asked me to accompany him to
where they were. I did so, and learned that
there were seven hundred from those States in
prison, many of whom had been incarcerated
ten or twelve months without any change of
clothing, or any comfort to relieve the gloom
and monotony of prison life. Among them
were lawyers, doctors, and clergymen&mdash;persons
who had been accustomed to the luxuries of
refined society, and the endearments of home.
A volume might be written, recording the
reflections, sufferings, and experiences of each
of these brothers, shut up there in a loathsome
prison for faithful adhesion to their loyalty.
During that night I slept but little, and said
less. My mind was busy in contemplation.</p>

<p>Mr. Rogers conducted me the next night to
a long board shanty, which was used as a hospital
for the sick and wounded. When I entered,
my heart sickened at the awful sight presented.
There were confined within that rough
wooden enclosure about one hundred sick and
dying, with nothing upon which to rest their
aching heads. We began the work of contributing
as much as possible to their comfort, and
of alleviating their sufferings. Most of them
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
were victims of typhoid fever. We had no
light to guide us, and the only way we could
distinguish the dead from the living was by
touch. From time to time was it our painful
duty to carry the dead bodies of these, our
fellow-prisoners, and lay them upon the grass,
where they would often be suffered to remain
two or three days, when, being tumbled into
rough boxes, they were put upon a dray, and
taken we knew not whither. This night was
one of gloom, loneliness, and desolation. Our
bed was the hard floor, and sleep was too “coy
a dame” to be won to conditions so comfortless
and lorn. I lay longing for the morning which
came at last; and never did I greet the light of
day more joyously than the 30th of May, 1862.
This was my first night in Macon, Georgia,
among the sick, dead, and dying. The place or
pen thus used for a hospital, and the ground
enclosing it, were of such limited dimensions, that
the large number of men found it impossible to
be other than exceedingly uncomfortable, and
their clothes became infested with bugs and
vermin.</p>

<p>The night of the 30th passed wearily away,
and ushered in the Sabbath&mdash;“soft halcyon on
life’s turbid waters.” The other ministers sought
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
to hold a meeting, and I went to the commandant
to obtain his consent, which, he granted.
With a light heart, I returned to my brother
ministers to report my success. A moment
after, a note was handed us, stating that no
religious services, public or private, would be
permitted. After the lapse of a brief period,
they concluded to send their own chaplain
to preach to us. But we declined to hear him;
and I was appointed to give our reasons therefor,
which I did as pertinently as possible.
They then threatened to force us to become
listeners to sentiments which were utterly incompatible
with our views of patriotism and
Christianity. But they parleyed, and finally
desisted from their threats.</p>

<p>It was here that I first became acquainted
with Lieutenant A. P. Collins, a gentleman of
refinement and culture, and with whom I was
destined afterward to share incredible sufferings
and perils. He was a religious man, and a
graduate of the Ohio Wesleyan University at
Delaware, Ohio. He had in his possession a
portion of the Old and New Testament, and
with this volume it was our wont every day to
repair to the shade of the pine-trees for meditation,
reading, and prayer. The idea of escaping
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
from our horrible imprisonment, which was
every day growing more and more severe,
seemed to enter both our minds at about the
same time, and we agreed to make it a subject
of special prayer. We shrank at the thought
of abandoning our comrades in distress; but
the hope of life, and the possibility of again
striking a blow for justice and right, stimulated
us while contemplating such a daring and dangerous
project. We looked upon the height
of the picket-fence that environed us, the vigilant
guard of four hundred men that watched
our every movement, and the battery of artillery
planted within the enclosure, and our
hearts oftentimes sank within us. But our
friends were dying around us, and day by day
we saw them deposited in rude boxes, hurried
for ever from our sight. Once we relinquished
our hope of personal deliverance, and determined
to remain with our brethren, and, if
necessary, die with them. Many who perished
there were noble men, though they passed away
“unwept, unhonored, and unsung.” We now
concluded to continue our prayer-meetings in
the hospital. In this work we seconded the
efforts of the Rev. Mr. Rogers, Dr. Doke, of
East Tennessee, and Dr. Fisk, of Illinois. We
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
had not acquainted these gentlemen with our
plans. Their names should never die, for</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Midst fawning priests and courtiers foul,</div>
<div class="verse">The losel swarm of crown and cowl,</div>
<div class="verse">White-robed walked these noble men,</div>
<div class="verse">Stainless as Uriel in the sun.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Their deeds of mercy were too many for
record here. No circumstances too repulsive,
no night too dark, no duty too onerous, but
they were ready for every good word and work.
Where suffering and pain were, there were they
present to alleviate and sympathize, and many
a poor fellow, now gone to his long home,
blessed them for prayers and consolations in
the night of death.</p>

<p>These noble philanthropists determined to
ask for something to mitigate the sufferings of
the prisoners, and accordingly made an appeal
through a humane surgeon for some bedding
on which the dying men might rest. This man
carried the message to the commandant, Major
Rylander, but that dignitary utterly refused to
listen to the appeal. The surgeon then endeavored
to awaken his humanity and Christian
feeling; but he replied to all this, by saying
very emphatically:</p>

<p>“Sir, I have laid off my robe of righteousness,
and put on one of blood, and the best way
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
to get rid of these d&mdash;&mdash;d Yankees is to let
them lay there and rot.”</p>

<p>Such was the conduct of this man Rylander.</p>

<p>We were compelled still to submit to our
fate, though we employed every effort in our
power to alleviate the sufferings of our dying
friends. One case, in particular, attracted my
attention. A political prisoner named Foote,
who had formerly been a captain of a steamboat
plying on the Florida rivers, being suspected
as a Union man, was arrested and
thrown into prison. He was occasionally visited
by his wife, and so careful were the rebels, notwithstanding
their boasted superiority, that two
guards with loaded guns were invariably detailed
to dog the footsteps of this woman. A
system of perfect espionage was constantly
maintained, and so suspicious were the rebels
of each other, that they would not permit a
single guard, in any case, to accompany a
prisoner. An instance of the most barbarous
torture it was ever my lot to behold, I witnessed
while here. It was inflicted upon a young man
from Illinois, for some offence unknown to me.
He was taken and stretched upon the ground,
face downward, his legs and arms drawn as far
apart as possible, and then pinned to the ground
by driving stakes across them; and in this state
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
of terrible torture was he left for twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p>Acts like these filled our hearts with the
most gloomy forebodings, and we began to
seriously deliberate the propriety of consummating
our previously contemplated escape.
We were about three hundred and fifty miles
from the nearest point where the stars and
stripes could be reached by water, and two
hundred and eighty miles by land. The distance
seemed to be insurmountable, to say
nothing of the impossibility of surviving the
hot weather. But the hope of liberty gave
zest to the project, and we determined at once
and for ever to abandon the scene of so much
horror and misery.</p>

Guard-lines&mdash;Frightened Horse&mdash;Halted&mdash;Passed&mdash;In
the Woods&mdash;Hidden in the Swamp&mdash;Pursued&mdash;A Night Journey
in the Cane-brake&mdash;Manna.</p>

<p class="noindent">We resolved to select a dark and rainy night to put
into execution our long cherished plan, and we waited anxiously for such
a night. The morning of the 1st of June, which was the anniversary of my
twenty-ninth birth-day, brought with it deep and long forgotten memories
of other days.</p>

<p>The next day I was attracted by the movements
of the old negro Dave, who was employed
in the menial services of the prison. He
was evidently well acquainted with our position,
and knew all about the state of affairs. As he
passed near me, he gave me a significant grin,
hung his head in assumed diffidence, and began
shoveling among the rubbish with all his might,
saying to me as he labored, just loud enough
for my ear, but looking all the while at his
work:</p>

<p>“You Yankees has jis made about a tousand
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
of the drefful rebels bite the dust up in Tennessee.
I golly, I’se glad!”</p>

<p>“Why, Dave, aren’t you a rebel, yourself?”</p>

<p>“No, <i>sah</i>, massa, I’se&mdash;”</p>

<p>Just here, a straggling rebel official sauntered
in sight, and our conversation was interrupted.
If any Federal prisoners were discovered holding
private consultations with the slaves, there
was a death penalty just so adjusted in the martial
laws of the Confederacy, as to meet the
case. I let the day pass without further effort
to see Dave.</p>

<p>The next day, however, finding a favorable
opportunity, I asked Dave if he could furnish
me three fish-hooks.</p>

<p>“God bless you, massa, yes!”&mdash;his eyes snapping
fire as he responded.</p>

<p>“Can you get me a tin full of salt, and a
paper of pepper?”</p>

<p>“Yes, massa!”</p>

<p>“Can you get me a box of matches?”</p>

<p>“Yes, massa; but how’s I gwine to get ’em
past the guards?”</p>

<p>“Try, Dave, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Bless your soul, massa, yes!”</p>

<p>I gave him the money, and when his chores
were done, he passed out, apparently one of the
most stupid darkies I ever saw. Fortunately
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
our conversation was not overheard, and I soon
was in possession of the desired articles.</p>

<p>During the day, I visited a Tennesseean&mdash;a
political prisoner&mdash;and proposed to exchange
clothes with him, to which he at once assented,
suspecting my object. He promised to be true,
and reveal nothing. We agreed upon an hour
when he should visit my quarters, at which
time we were to exchange our clothing. I then
informed Collins what I had done, and he made
a similar arrangement with another Tennesseean.</p>

<p>Time passed wearily on, and brought the
night of the 18th of June,<a id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a
href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
which was dark and rainy, and promised fairly for our proposed
adventure. In due time our United States uniform was exchanged, and we
were clad in rebel rags. Our hearts beat high with hope, and we were
resolved to escape or perish in the attempt.</p>



<p>About half past eight o’clock, we slowly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
crawled out of the prison&mdash;Collins a little in the
rear.</p>

<p>This, with the exception of crossing the
guard-lines, we apprehended would be the most
dangerous part of our undertaking, and our
movements were consequently slow and cautious.
We continued to advance, keeping
within whispering distance of each other, until
we reached a little clump of pines near the
fence, which point we had previously selected
as a rendezvous. Here we paused to make further
arrangements. We felt certain, now, that
if we were discovered, we would be shot. Life
for us was only in pressing warily forward.
After a minute’s consultation, in the lowest
whispers, it was agreed that I should take the
advance, and that should I be discovered, and
shot, he should return to his quarters; but if I
succeeded in passing the guard-lines, and reaching
our second rendezvous&mdash;a thicket of fallen
bushes between the guard-lines and picket-fence&mdash;I
was then to announce my success by a
single clap of the hands, which would be a signal
for him to follow.</p>

<p>I accordingly lay down on my face, and crept
quietly outward through the lines. The intense
darkness prevented my seeing a guard, who
chanced to be stationed close to my path. I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
came within six feet of him, and could distinguish
that he was reposing carelessly against a
tree, playing with the rammer of his gun, the
noise of which served to keep me from running
against him. It was the most thrilling moment
of my life! But I soon got beyond the sound
of the clicking ramrod of an enemy whose business
it was to shoot just such adventurers as
myself, and I began to breathe a little more
freely as I neared our second rendezvous. In a
few minutes I was safe outside the lines, and
snugly hidden beneath the dark foliage of the
tangled bushes. Just as I was about giving the
signal to Collins, I discovered that I had frightened
an artillery horse so much, that he broke
loose from his hitching-rack, and in another
moment it seemed as if all rebeldom were out
in pursuit of him. Now I should be discovered!
To run or lie still would be death. An
unseen Deliverer gave me presence of mind. I
resolved to turn rebel for the time being, and
assist in catching the horse. My life depended
on the action of that moment. I ordered all
the rebels astir, assuming as best I could the
arrogant Southern tone of authority, to assist
me in securing the animal, and had the gratification
of seeing him caught and led away, wondering
whether that would be the last of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
“catching” to be done that night! Again I
started for our place of rendezvous; but being
somewhat excited, and the darkness and rain of
the night adding to my bewilderment, I ran
against an artillery guard, who instantly exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Halt, dar!”</p>

<p>My unseen Protector again aided me, and I
once more assumed the rebel tone and manner.
I replied, with as much offended dignity as my
beating heart would allow:</p>

<p>“Halt, whar?”</p>

<p>“Who are you, sah?”</p>

<p>“Have you been here so long, sir, and don’t
know me yet? What’s this mean, sir? Don’t
you understand your business, sir?”</p>

<p>“O, yes, sah, I know you, now; you ’long
to that thar battallin over thar. Go on, sah!”</p>

<p>Soon after this, I succeeded in reaching our
appointed place of meeting, but believing that
the confusion of the guards in capturing the
frightened horse had prevented Collins from
attempting to follow, I went down to the fence
alone. Five minutes later, I heard my comrade
giving the signal at the outer rendezvous, to
which I instantly responded, and in a very few
minutes we were both outside the picket-fence,
on the dismal banks of the Ocmulgee river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>We traveled fifteen miles before sunrise, and,
just at daylight, crossed the river on a railroad
bridge, leaving it between us and our enemies.
It was a glorious summer morning. The birds,
all beautiful and free, were chirping their matin
praises. The fields and forests were fragrant
with the blessed baptism of dews, and glittered
in rare brilliance before the rising sun. All
nature was clad in robes of royalty, and voiced
to sweet anthems of rejoicing. But we were
weary wanderers, homeless and hated, fallen
among thieves and robbers in the midst of our
native land. As the daylight grew stronger,
we resolved to secrete ourselves in the thicket
among the croaking frogs, and lie low in the
dense undergrowth among the reptiles of the
cane-brake. We were destitute of provisions.
In our haversacks were the matches, salt, pepper
and fish-hooks. We kindled a small fire, and
burnt our papers. We did this regretfully, for
we had some valuable notes and memoranda
among them, but we chose to suffer their positive
loss, rather than risk the danger of a recapture
with them still in our possession. It
was a sad sacrifice, in a solitary sanctuary, on a
strange altar. Yet our safety demanded it, and
it was done.</p>

<p>Our situation was now both desolate and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
dangerous. We were in the midst of a vast
cane-brake, the extent and surroundings of
which were altogether unknown to us. The
tall, straight cane-growths, like steady fingers,
pointed upward to a land of liberty on high,
and we knew a Present Guide thither, but we
were without chart or compass in this lower
wilderness.</p>

<p>About three o’clock in the afternoon, we
ventured to the road, keeping a vigilant lookout
in every direction, dreading the sight of
white men, and ardently hoping to see the face
of some lowly slave, in order to arrange with
our ever-faithful friends and now brothers in
common peril and oppression, for something to
eat. For a long time we lay silent and watchful
beneath the broad leaves of the swamp
palm, close by the road-side; but instead of
discovering a sympathizing negro to whom we
might appeal for food and friendship, what was
our bitter disappointment at discovering six
armed men on horseback, in pursuit of us!
They were making diligent search. We could
see them dismount and examine all probable
lurking-places to the right and left of the road
as they passed along. As they came nearer, we
heard their savage curses, and the threatened
tortures that awaited us if recaptured. They
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
circled the thicket, and penetrated at every
possible angle all about us; but we were so
completely concealed that nothing but personal
contact would reveal our hiding-place. At one
time, our pursuers were within a few feet of us.
They must have known we were in that brake,
for they lingered within hearing until nightfall,
when they abandoned the search. How thankfully
beat our hearts as the sound of their
horses’ hoofs died away in the rearward distance!</p>

<p>There was an advantage to us in what we at
first so dreaded&mdash;the proximity of these men.
We were thereby enabled to overhear their
plans of pursuit. They agreed to set watches
at certain points on the road, the river, and
railroad leading to Darien. We were quite confident
we had been betrayed by some cowardly
prisoner, and suspected that fellow named Clinton,
from Mississippi.</p>

<p>We learned from our pursuers themselves, as
they were searching for us, that this traitor of
traitors gave the authorities of the prison all
the information they desired, for he had played
eaves-dropper more than once, rebel and prisoner
as he was! He had actually mapped our
proposed route, although our scheme was arranged
between Collins and myself in whispers.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
But we were silently thankful for the information
we received, and when we ascertained the
plan of pursuit, we fixed our course so as to
elude their pickets.</p>

<p>With a thanksgiving and a prayer, we resolved
to continue our journey immediately
with the beginning of the night. The night
was calm and clear. All the sounds that broke
the stillness were the hoarse croakings of the
frogs, and the distant barking of watch-dogs on
the plantations. Looking up to God for guidance,
he gave us a glimpse of the North Star,
the fugitive’s light of hope. We started in a
south-east direction, through the cane-brake,
traveling part of the time through dirty, stagnant
water two feet deep, and sometimes almost to
our arms; but it was a venture for life, and we
urged our way patiently onward, until we came
to water so deep that we were obliged to stop,
and wait for the morning. We hailed the day-dawn
with delight, hungry and weary as we
were, for we had not tasted a mouthful of food
since we left the prison. As soon as the grayish
light appeared, we discovered that we were on
the bank of a swail, beyond which, on a little
elevation of land, was one of the richest blackberry
fields I ever saw. It was like manna in
the wilderness. With these delicious berries we
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
appeased our hunger, and were strengthened
for new hardships. The forenoon was one of
peculiar beauty to us. We found our Comforting
Friend in that sacred retreat, present to
cheer our souls and feed our bodies. We rested
a few hours, and talked of the goodness of the
Lord. Occasionally we would see a strange,
unknown reptile glide among the dense ground-foliage,
or hear the song of some strange wild-bird.
We again started on our way, trying to
pass the time pleasantly by remarking the new
varieties of vegetation that everywhere met the
eye&mdash;the wild-flowers, the singular leaves, the

<p class="noindent">About two o’clock, we ventured to leave the
swamp, and strike out for the low hills, and
travel through the pines. It was the 20th of
June, and a long day to us. We had scarcely
entered the pine forest, when we saw eight men
with guns, on the lookout for us, some of whom
we had previously seen on the same errand.
We instantly retreated to the swamp, yet not
before we were discovered. The dogs were instantly
put on our track, and in order to break
the scent, we again sought the swail, and waded
in water to our knees. We passed through
the densest portions of the brake, where it
stood thick and tall, forming, in places, an
almost impenetrable wall of stalks, which we
carefully adjusted behind us. After several
hours of this cautious traveling and covering
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
our way, we were obliged to lie down among
the swamp palm-leaves for rest. We could distinctly
hear the baying of the bloodhounds in
search of our track, but we felt pretty well assured
they would not be able to follow it. The
next morning found us wet and weary, and
quite chilled by the dampness of our bed. We
thought to make our way out to the pine hills,
but had hardly concluded to hazard the attempt,
when we again heard the hounds nearer than
before. We then penetrated yet further into
the tangled cane-thicket, for it had become a
welcome retreat for us. By patient endurance
we again baffled our enemies, only, however, to
find ourselves threatened with starvation. We
tried to catch fish, but failed. We were even
“unlucky” in our attempts to take frogs from
the swail with our hooks. Our forlorn situation
can better be imagined than described.
Cold, wet, hungry, weak from exposure, heartsick
with disappointments, and, worse than all,
pursued as criminals by those who should have
befriended us, we were almost ready to despair,
and lie down to die in the midst of the dismal
swamp. I felt that indeed strange changes had
occurred in my life; for, only a few months
before, I was a free man, surrounded by the kindest
of friends, happy in my cottage home, or in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
my pastoral walks among the people whom I
loved. But now I was compelled to flee for
life, half clad and half starved, to the heart of
a watery wilderness! From our covert of
shade we watched the sun go down, and felt the
quiet night coming on. Oh! dreary evening!
sunless, hopeless, comfortless, and dark! thy
memory haunts me still! But we lost not our
confidence in God. We knelt in the black
water, and prayed. And down through the
still night&mdash;down through the deep darkness&mdash;down
through the dense cane-brake&mdash;down to
our prostrate souls afar in the solitude, came the
Blessed Comforter, and we took courage. We
thought of the old Jews, compelled to wander
about in sheep-skins and goat-skins. We
trusted in Elijah’s and Elisha’s God, and remembered
that Daniel had dwelt safely in the
den of lions. We were so completely thrown
upon God’s mercy, that our faith was stronger
than ever. We felt that God was nearer in
the shadows than in the sunshine&mdash;that in
bowing in the water of the swamp to pray, we
placed our lips nearer to the Infinite Ear
than if we worshipped in temples on the mountain.</p>

<p>We spent the entire day, the 21st of June,
in this bog. When night came, we tried again
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
to sleep, but were annoyed by a new enemy&mdash;a
legion strong&mdash;the pestiferous musquitoes. During
the night, our attention was attracted by a
sound like the driving of a stake. We arose
and cautiously reconnoitered in the direction
from which the noise proceeded. To our surprise,
we came upon a small corn-field, containing
about two acres, surrounded by a rude fence
of pine poles. We trembled at the thought of
being so near a human habitation; and after
pulling a few stalks of the young corn to eat,
we hastened into the thicket, and traveled on.
The roots of the corn, cleansed and salted, were
eaten with a relish. The sound which had
arrested our attention proved to be that produced
by an insect of the beetle species, and the
painful stillness and solitude of the place, served
to make it more impressive than it would otherwise
have been. The North Star was our only
guide; and shaping our course by its uncertain
light, we again resumed our journey. We had
not traveled far, however, until we became
completely bewildered in the cane-brake. The
sluggish water spread on every side, the thick
cane and underbush so mingled and commingled,
that it was impossible to move in any direction.
Again we concluded to tarry for the daylight;
and breaking a few cane-stalks, and laying them
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
on the ground near a mossy log, for a bed, we
tried to sleep. We were frequently disturbed
in the night by prowling animals, but none of
them was so terrible to think of as our human
pursuers. Judging it best to guard against all
surprises from man or beast, we agreed to
sleep and stand sentinel alternately until morning.
Thus we relieved and rested each other
that memorable night.</p>

<p>It was a welcome day-dawn to us. For two
hours I had stood guard over Collins, watching
the stars mirrored on the smooth waters about
our feet, and it was a glorious sunrise to us that
chased the shadows and images away, and
flooded our gloomy retreat with the light of
morning. Again we started onward, taking
the sun for our guide. The water grew gradually
more and more shallow, and the brushwood
thicker. Berries became scarcer, and our
sufferings from hunger increased with every
step. We were that day wandering weary, foot-sore,
and heart-heavy, where in all probability,
human foot had never trod before:</p>

</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
<div class="verse">“Where hardly a human foot would pass,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Or a human heart would dare,</div>

<div class="verse">We crouched in the thick and tangled grass,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Like wild beasts in their lair.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>On we pressed, amid the wild voices of the
dark cane forest. Our progress was slow. By-and-by,
as we came upon a mossy log, we tarried
and tried to rest our aching heads. We soon
fell asleep, being overcome by fatigue. I
dreamed of my loved ones at home&mdash;of watchful
eyes and praying voices in our behalf. I
saw the old familiar hill-slope before my cottage
door, the orchard, the fields, and, better
than all, the friends of other days, and myself
among them&mdash;all happy at the old homestead
in free Ohio. Some hovering angel must have
come and held the picture before my eyes, for I
was in raptures of delight! Suddenly I was
aroused from my slumbers by the tread of some
animal, I knew not what. As I stirred, it
hastened into the dark foliage and was gone. I
awakened my comrade and told him it was
morning. He was surprised to think he had
slept so long, and both of us were greatly refreshed.
Again we prayed and pressed onward
for home and friends, and for a sight of the
Stars and Stripes. We had decided on keeping
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
steadily on in a south-easterly course until we
reached some point on the sea-coast then in
our possession. The sun beamed hotly over
our heads. We traveled as fast as possible all
day, hoping that we might find some negro&mdash;none
else in that region were human beings&mdash;and
through the aid of slaves get something to
eat, for we were actually starving. We captured
a frog that day, and divided the precious
morsel between us, with thanksgiving. At
night we lay down, but hunger and faintness
prohibited repose. We longed for morning.
We gazed upward to the twinkling stars, praying
them to speed faster through the firmament,
and let the sun arise. At length the blushing
morn appeared. I hailed it as the dawn of an
eventful day, for now we must seek and obtain
food, or perish in the swamp. The idea of falling
into the hands of our enemies chilled our
very souls. We thought to die alone, and “let
the dead bury the dead” in the wilderness,
rather than suffer ourselves to be recaptured
and tortured to death by inches, to gratify the
jeering, jabbering multitudes. But the day
was come when something more must be ventured
for life’s sake. At last dawn came, and
again we fell upon our knees and asked for
wisdom and direction in the hour of need.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Rising comforted and strengthened, we changed
our course, and pressed forward, expecting to
emerge from the cane-brake and find a plantation
where there were slaves. The undergrowth
was so dense that we could with difficulty make
about one mile per hour. The day was fast
passing away, and so was our strength. At
about three o’clock in the afternoon, we sat
down, almost in despair, and held a council,
when we decided that nothing but the hand of
the Lord could deliver us. Again we bowed
ourselves before Him, and rose refreshed both
in mind and body. Our steps were elastic&mdash;our
hearts gladdened, and we hurried onward, under
the conscious protection of God.</p>

<p>Suddenly, I heard the barking of a dog not
far distant. We paused and listened. It was
not a bloodhound. Collins, being a little deaf
from the effects of terrific artillery-firing at
Shiloh, did not, at first, catch the sound. Now
we knew that help was near. We quickened
our pace, and in a few minutes heard the voices
of some negro men. A few steps farther, and
we came in sight of a cotton-field, which we
approached by walking in the water of a small
brook that flowed in that direction. With
great caution, we neared the field, in which there
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
were twenty-five negroes at work ploughing cotton.
Most of the men looked old and toil-worn.
While we were reconnoitering our ground, I
observed an old, gray-haired man nearing the
fence with his furrow, and when he paused a
moment to scrape his plough, before returning
across the field, I rapped on a rail, which instantly
drew his attention. When I caught his
eye, I beheld an intellect and a sympathy languaged
there which gave me hope. I approached
the old man with trembling step and
faltering voice, I know, for there was danger of
communicating with some excitable and treacherous
slave&mdash;although such are rare cases&mdash;yet
I ventured to speak to my wondering auditor. I
approached that cotton-field, half famished as I
was, with many of my Virginia prejudices
against the negroes, for I had been taught to
regard them as unreliable and stupid. But I
felt that death was in the swamp, and life <i>might</i>
be in the cotton-field.</p>

<p>“Well, uncle,” said I, “I am traveling
through your country, and I am very ragged, as
you see. I don’t wish to call on white folks in
this condition, and I am very hungry. Could
you get me something to eat?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, massa! God bless you! all you
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
want; but go back! go back!” he continued,
waving his hand, as if to hurry me back to our
hiding-place; “go back, massa! they’s after you
wid de houns and de horses! Do you see dat
ole cabin up dar, in dat field? To-night, just
at ’leven o’clock, come to dat cabin, massa, and
I’ll gin you all de supper you want. Now, go
back! go back, massa!”</p>

<p>“Uncle, you won’t bring anybody with you,
will you?”</p>

<p>“Why, God bless you, massa. <i>I knows
you! I knows you!</i>”</p>

<p>“Now, uncle, what do you know about me?”</p>

<p>“Why, you’s one of dem Yankees dat
broke away from Macon prison, massa. <i>I
knows you!</i> God bless you!”</p>

<p>“Well, uncle, don’t tell that to anybody, will
you?”</p>

<p>“Tinks <i>I</i> tell anybody, massa, when all I’s
got in dis worl’ depends on ye? No, no, massa!
But go back! go back, till ’leven o’clock! mine,
now, massa!” and he started after his plough,
for by this time the other hands were approaching.
I went back, and reported the prospects
to my comrade. We concealed ourselves
in the thick brush to await the appointed hour.
Just at dusk, the slaves unhitched their mules,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
finished up their rows, and started for their
cabins, singing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“We’ll soon be done wagging with the crosses,</div>
<div class="verse">We’ll soon be done wagging with the crosses,</div>
<div class="verse">We’ll soon be done wagging with the crosses,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And wing, and wing, and wing with the angels,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And den wing with the angels,</div>
<div class="verse">In the New Jerusalem!”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It was weird, eccentric music, but really the
most thrilling I had ever heard, as it rose
through the still evening air in rich, mellow
accord from the voices of the whole company
of slaves returning to their humble homes for
supper and rest. I thought, how little the
people in the North knew about these <i>crosses</i>!
and I silently but fervently prayed for the day
to hasten when all these weary ones might find
the liberty for which they sang and suffered.</p>

<p>The hours passed slowly away, but at length
the appointed hour of eleven o’clock drew nigh.
We left our retreat, and advanced with the
utmost caution, until we came within thirty
yards of the cabin, when we lay down in a
brier-path to watch for whatever movements
might occur. For a few minutes we were kept
in suspense, not feeling fully satisfied whether
friend or foe might advance to meet us. Soon,
however, the faithful old negro came to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
designated trysting-place. He was evidently
alone. He walked round and round the cabin,
looking and waiting for us, and on seeing us
not, seemed greatly disappointed. When we
had assured ourselves that no one was with
him, and that he was true, we arose from our
concealment, and walked to the cabin. He was
rejoiced to see our confidence in him, and was
as thankful to give, as we were to receive, the
rich repast he had prepared for us. Our supper
consisted of corn-bread, smoked bacon, and
boiled cauliflowers. He also brought us a
bottle of sweetened water. What a feast!
Never did I partake of food with such a relish.
We received it as directly from the hand of
Him who “heareth the young ravens when
they cry.” Being assured by our old friend that
we were perfectly safe, we tarried after supper
several hours, conversing on the state of our
country, and receiving advice as to the manner
of proceeding on our journey. As the venerable
man talked to us, telling as how to escape
to our homes and friends, sharing his sympathies
and his means with as poor destitute
wanderers, my old prejudices of caste were
entirely obliterated. Beneath that dark brow
was the mind of a man, and within that slave’s
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
bosom beat a brother’s heart. I could have
embraced him as my father.</p>

<p>“Now, massa,” said he, as we were about to
separate until all true friends shall meet in
heaven, “now do jis as I tells you, and you’ll
git away. You keep dis pine-ridge straight
on through massa’s plantation for five mile.
Dis ridge goes clean to de coast. It’s ’bout
three hundred mile to de coast by de Ocmulgee
riber. The Ocmulgee flows into de Altamaha,
and Darien is at de mouth of de Altamaha,
and you’ll find lots of de Yankees dar.”</p>

<p>The old man understood the times. His
knowledge of the war, with all its recent and
important movements, was thorough and accurate,
although he was careful and somewhat
reticent, even in his communications to us. In
order to test his professed knowledge of us,
and to ascertain all we could relative to our
pursuers, we plied him with various questions.</p>

<p>“Well, uncle,” said we, “I suppose you know
we are running from the conscript?”</p>

<p>“No, sah, I knows you is the Yankees what
broke out o’ jail at Macon, dat’s what I knows.”</p>

<p>“You’re right, uncle. Now what do you
know about this war?”</p>

<p>“I doesn’t know much about it, sah; only I
knows dat dey say, if de Yankees whips, de
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
darkies all be free, but if dese har rebels whips,
den we be slaves.”</p>

<p>“Which do you prefer should gain the day?”</p>

<p>“Why, God bless you, massa! does you tink
I’s a fool? Course, I wants you to whip.”</p>

<p>“You say they are hunting us; how many
have they after us?”</p>

<p>“I doesn’t know jis zacly; but I knows dat
tree men come to massa day ’fore yesterday for
to git a bloodhound to hunt Yankees with
what runned away from Macon prison.”</p>

<p>I confess that the thought of being pursued
by bloodhounds was horrifying in the extreme;
and notwithstanding we had already seen two
large packs at different times upon our track,
the possible death by these fierce monsters in
this wilderness made my blood run cold.</p>

<p>Our further conversation gave us a full and
satisfactory knowledge of our route, and was
delineated by our sable friend, as we had afterward
reason to know, with perfect geographical
accuracy. We asked him that in case we
should be pursued by the bloodhounds, what
means we should employ to bewilder them.
This was no new subject to him. He, in common
with his fellow-bondmen, had seen too
many instances in which these brutes had been
employed in capturing fugitives, not to know
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
their nature, as well as the plans adopted to
elude them. He told us when the dogs followed
us in the cane-brake, in order to prevent them
from keeping the trail, we should travel as
much as possible in the water; but if we
should be closely pursued, to leave the cane-brake,
and take to the Ocmulgee river. He
assured us that the dogs were fearful of the
alligators with which that river abounded, and
that the slaves were taught that alligators would
destroy only negroes and dogs. He didn’t
believe it himself, although his master thought
he did. He added:</p>

<p>“If dem houns gits close on to you, why you
jis git a long pole, and hop about twenty feet,
if you kin. You do dis four or five times, and
whenever you light, why jis put some pepper in
de holes what your heels make, and when de
houns come, dey lose dar scent, and den dey
goes a snufflin and a snufflin roun’, and bymeby
dey snuffles up dat ’ar pepper into dar nostrils,
and den dey’ll go chee! chee! chee! and dat’ll
be de last dem dogs can do dat day.”</p>

<p>This piece of information, and the manner in
which it was conveyed, accompanied as it was
by violent gyrations of the body, and an exact
imitation of dog-sneezing, was very amusing;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
and though surrounded by forbidding circumstances,
we indulged in an audible smile.</p>

<p>From this man we first learned of a complete
organization among the negroes, for the purpose
of aiding fugitives in making their escape. It
was similar to an institution which I had often
heard of as existing in the Northern States,
under the name of “Underground Railroad.”
The officers of this Southern Underground
Railroad, on which we were glad to take passage,
were the slaves of the different plantations,
who were thoroughly acquainted with their
duties, and were very suspicious lest they should
be imposed upon. When we inquired how
these men should know us, he told us that he
would arrange that matter, so that we need
have no fears, but to submit ourselves to their
guidance, and all would be well.</p>

<p>We traveled that night through the plantation
belonging to the master of this black man.
We reached the woods just a little before the
dawn of day, and here we lay down until a
faint light streamed in from “the windows of
morning,” when we resumed our journey. All
was lone and silent. The wood through which
we went, with its alluring depths&mdash;the verdant
moss beneath our eager feet&mdash;each blossom-laden,
fragrant bough&mdash;and the bearded grasses
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
that shook in the wind,&mdash;all gave me their secret
sigh. All the sweet land around&mdash;the distant
hill&mdash;the distant shore, said, “Redeem me
from my chains!”</p>

<p class="noindent">While thus making our way through the forest,
we fancied we heard the sound of pursuers,
and were once more obliged to take refuge in
the dismal, but now welcome cane-brake. Just
where we entered the swamp, the water was
very shallow, and, consequently, afforded us
but poor protection from the bloodhounds,
whose peculiar cries we expected to hear every
moment. We therefore made our way with
as much haste as possible far into our miry
retreat, where the depth of mud and water
secured us from the scenting of the fearful animals
and their bloodthirsty masters.</p>

<p>Presently we came upon a stream of water,
which, diverging from the river at a point above,
made a circuit, and fell into the river again at a
point below us, thus converting the area it embraced
into an island. The water looked deep,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
and we did not relish a soaking, after having
our clothes dried during our stay in the woods.
But once on the island, our safety was insured
for there was no ferry-boat, nor even a skiff, in
that silent, murky swamp, by which our would-be
captors might cross over. Besides, we had
seen too many hardships to be frightened by
trifles, and we therefore plunged boldly in, my
brave comrade taking the advance, and soon
reached the island.</p>

<p>That night, June 24th, we made ourselves a
bed on the banks of the Ocmulgee, by cutting
down the canes which grew around us in luxuriance.
We also kindled a fire, after screening
the spot so effectually as to prevent its light
reaching the eyes of any foe; and by its cheering
flames we partially dried our wet and ragged
clothing. Casting ourselves upon our rude
couch, we watched the beautiful stars in the distant
realm on high, and listened to the murmurs
of the crystal stream that was protecting
us from pursuit, until at last we fell into a deep
slumber. Just before closing our eyes, we heard,
at some little distance below us, a noise resembling
that which might be made by a huge log,
one end of which was caught upon a sand-bank,
and the other playing loosely in the stream.
But we were too sleepy to suppose that there
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
was any danger indicated by the odd sound, and
we paid no attention to it.</p>

<p>Protected by that God who watched Hagar in
the wilderness, we slept peacefully until day-dawn,
when we were suddenly aroused by the
most terrific noise I had ever heard. It resembled
the sound of a heavy steam-whistle, though
not quite so loud nor shrill. Remembering at
the moment a description by the Rev. Joshua
Boucher, who had traveled in Georgia, of the
bellowing of an alligator, I at once concluded
that this must be one. Stepping from my tent,
or rather cane-hut, I had ocular demonstration
of the fact, for there, only a short distance from
me, lay the hideous reptile in all his ugliness.
Thinking it about time that one or the other of
us should change quarters, I threw a chunk
at him. He took the hint, and crawled away
into the water, only, however, to return in about
ten minutes to his old post, where, opening his
fearful jaws, and keeping them so until they
were covered with flies, he snapped them together
with a report that chilled our blood.
This was Wednesday morning, June 25, and we
intended to remain all day in the swamp, for the
river was lined with boys and negroes. During
the afternoon, we espied a skiff on the opposite
side, and laid several plans to obtain possession
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
of it, but they were all frustrated. This proved
to be a blessing, however, for, while making our
last attempt, we were seen by an old negro, who
seemed to recognize us immediately. From this
lowly slave we learned that the river was
guarded for miles, to prevent our escape. Our
pursuers were on the watch for us all the way
to Hockinsville. This newly-found friend
pointed out to us our only path of escape, and
appointed a spot where he would meet us at
midnight, and bring us some food. We blessed
the negro, and, following his directions, reached
the place of refuge, where we anxiously awaited
his second appearance. But the hour passed on,
and so did several more, but he came not. He
had, doubtless, been seized by the patrollers.</p>

<p>The sun of the 26th found us still pressing
forward. We had gotten thus far, like the old
apostles, with “neither scrip nor staves,” but
we felt that God was with us, and his servants,
the poor, downtrodden slaves, helped us on.
Whenever we met one of the latter, who replied
to our question, “Can’t dis yer day,” he
was a friend, but unable to assist us on account
of the patrollers. If one answered, “I know
you,” he was posted, and all was well.</p>

<p>We passed the night in the pine-woods, I
remaining awake, and guarding my friend, Collins,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
who was completely worn out. During
the next day, we made a good distance, in spite
of numerous difficulties. By the 28th, our
rebel clothing was well nigh worn off us, and
our hunger began to increase terribly. In the
evening, we came upon some slaves in a field,
among whom were several females, about
eighteen or twenty years of age. The latter
were almost naked, having nothing on them save
a very short skirt, fastened round the waist, and
held in its place by straps, which passed over
the shoulders. All the upper portion of the
body, and about three-fourths of the nether
limbs, were thereby exposed. None of their
complexions were black, while one or two of
them were nearly white. We agreed with
these slaves to hide ourselves in a neighboring
lane until night, when they promised to bring
us food. Shortly after, one of them brought
us the unwelcome intelligence that we were in
danger, and warned us to again take to the
swamp, which was some half a mile away.
This we did, and after wandering some time
along the edge thereof, sat down at last beside
a clear crystal spring, in which were sporting
numbers of beautiful fish. We could hear the
negroes singing in the field&mdash;which exercise
was a signal we understood to mean that we
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
should lie still until it ceased, when we might
safety venture out to the lane&mdash;until about
nine o’clock, when all became quiet. By midnight
we returned to our designated hiding-place,
where we were soon joined by a black
man and one of the girls, a beautiful, modest
creature we had seen in the corn-field. They
brought us fat meat, corn-bread, greens, and
“bonny-clabber,” which was a welcome sight
to us. During the conversation we held with
these negroes, we learned that their master had
gone to the war, leaving them in the charge of
an overseer. We ascertained, also, that “the
Yankees” had possession of Darien, on the
coast, and that, in consequence, the slaves had
been removed into the interior of Georgia.
Close by there were three hundred rice-farm
hands encamped, who were in a starving condition,
having been driven to the interior of
the State by their masters, in order to prevent
confiscation, and being unable to make a living
for themselves. Our humble friends informed
us that if we continued straight on we would
reach Darien in two days, provided we exercised
due caution to avoid the patrollers, who,
since our escape from Macon, had been searching
for us vigilantly. The night was well nigh
all spent in conversation with these slaves, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
we had not got much further on our way, when
the dawn broke upon us, compelling us to leave
the road and take to the pines. We were subsequently
obliged to leave even these, and
plunge once more into the more friendly
swamps.</p>

<p>After our slender stock of provisions was
exhausted, we became exceedingly hungry, and
the day passed away without our obtaining
even so much as a frog or fish. We slumbered
all the night, which was chilly and damp, in
the cane-brake. A fire which we had kindled,
we were obliged to extinguish, for fear that its
light might point out our refuge to some
enemy. During the stilly hours that followed,
we were once disturbed by a strange noise,
which, I subsequently ascertained, in a conversation
with Rev. Dr. Kost, must have been
made by a panther.</p>

<p>The next day, being terribly fatigued and
hungry, we resolved to make an attempt at
replenishing our commissary department. The
sun came up bright and very hot, and our
journey through the swamp-palms was indeed
a toilsome one; but these self-same palms secured
us against our pursuers, and we therefore
did not complain.</p>

<p>An effort that we made shortly after to leave
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
the marsh, discovered to us our pursuers, and
we were once more forced back to our muddy
asylum, where we concealed ourselves beneath
a muscadine vine until twelve o’clock. While
so concealed, a strange noise fell upon our ears,
and presently we saw a black man coming directly
toward us, blowing a horn to call swine.
When he was about thirty feet from us, we
called to him, with the expectation of learning
from him at what points on the river the guards
were stationed, and also of obtaining from him
something to eat.</p>

<p>Upon being first hailed, he exclaimed, “Don’t
know you, sah!” and when, stepping from my
concealment, I called to him a second time, he
seemed terrified. The next instant he fled
madly away from us, we pursuing him desperately,
in order to secure him, and thus save ourselves
from new pursuers. But, notwithstanding
the fact that he carried a bushel basket half
filled with corn upon his back, he distanced us.
Once he stumbled in a swail, and sent the corn
and mud all over himself, but he quickly regained
his feet, and was soon after lost to our
view.</p>

“We beheld the glistening eyes of the hounds, saw their
long tongues lolling from between their powerful jaws, and saw their
large, terrible teeth shining like pearls.”&mdash;Page 139.
</div>
</div>

<p>We were now indeed in peril; and very
shortly afterward, the wild bay of the bloodhounds
rang upon our ears through the murky
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
air of the morass. Nearer, clearer, deadlier
came the dreadful sounds, and we crouched in
our retreat, expecting every moment to see the
ferocious animals bounding upon us. But,
thank God for his watchful mercy, the brutes,
misguided by a stratagem which the negroes
had taught us how to execute, were deceived,
and we had the infinite delight of seeing them
dash into the stream, swim to the other side,
and then, renewing their fierce cries, bound
away, closely followed by fifteen human bloodhounds
mounted on fleet horses. The peril
was not past yet, however, for, finding themselves
thrown from the scent, the well-trained
brutes soon came back to the stream, recrossed
to the side we were on, and coming to our old
track, lay down, snuffing and panting, not a
hundred yards from us. Think of that, reader!
Peeping through the canes we beheld the glistening
eyes of the hounds, saw their long
tongues lolling from between their powerful
jaws, and saw their large, terrible teeth shining
like pearls.</p>

<p>Their savage masters stood on the bank of
the swail cursing us, and threatening what they
would do if they retook us. Once more the
God of our fathers stretched forth His arm and
delivered us, for, hearing them post their men
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
we struck away from them in a northern direction,
and shortly had the satisfaction of leaving
them some fifteen miles in the rear.</p>

<p>Onward, onward we pushed, until so overcome
with fatigue that we were fain to stretch
ourselves upon the sand and sleep. This was
July 3d. The succeeding day&mdash;the Fourth&mdash;broke
upon us bright and beautifully, and we
sped forward with all the power of our limbs.
We came at last to a very scanty corn-field,
which, as we learned from the slaves who
attended to it, yielded only about two and a
half bushels to the acre. Cotton was the staple
in that region, and with it were bought all the
necessaries of life. Poor as was the corn, however,
we carefully confiscated some roasting-ears,
on which, with half of a frog, we made
our Fourth-of-July dinner, thanking our Divine
Preserver for the gift. The remaining half of
the frog was carefully reserved, with some corn,
for a future meal.</p>

<p>The morrow was cloudy and cool. We were
now drawing near to the coast, for, as we went
along, we espied a turtle belonging to a species
that lived only in salt water. His shell was extremely
beautiful, and would, doubtless, have
been very valuable had we thought about dollars
and cents; but some berries, which we
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
found, were of far greater worth to us at that
time.</p>

<p>Night found us still wandering in the land of
rattlesnakes, scorpions, and traitors. Next day,
while hunting a sweet-potato patch for a stray
root or two, we saw a negro man, to whom we
did not, however, get a chance to speak. Fearing
that he might not, perhaps, be friendly, we
once more betook ourselves to the pines, where,
although we did not know it at the time, we
were hotly pursued. Soon afterwards, the rain
fell in torrents, while the thunder rolled in
heavy peals, and the lightning played sharply
about us. When evening came, we were
soaking wet, and chilled through; and coming
to an old dilapidated building, that was overgrown
with Spanish moss, and seemed as though
it had been uninhabited for many a year, we
hurried into it. By the aid of the lightning, we
found that it was nearly filled with half-wild
goats, which, on our arrival, hastily evacuated
the premises, leaving us in free and undisputed
possession. The structure was nothing more
than an old church, with some rude benches in
one end, and a ruined chancel at the other. I
here found some leaves of a Bible, upon which
I pillowed my head for the night, and slept the
more sweetly that I did so. Adjoining this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
church was a graveyard, containing some rough
tombstones, beneath which slept the dead ones
of many years, all unconscious of the events
passing above their heads.</p>

<p>The following day we left our retreat, and
continued our flight in the midst of a terrible
storm. About three o’clock, we discovered a
sweet-potato patch, but it had been completely
stripped of every root. That night, unable, on
account of having got our matches wet, to kindle
a fire, we slept in a corn-field, pulling the dried
stalks over us to partially shelter us from the
descending rain. The next day, we resumed
our flight, or rather our wading, for every rivulet
was swollen to a good-sized creek. In endeavoring
to cross a turbid stream upon the
“giddy footing” of a loose log, we were precipitated
into twelve feet of water, and were
obliged to swim to the other shore, grateful
that we escaped with nothing worse than a
ducking.</p>

<p class="noindent">We were now within thirty-five miles of the
coast, and here the river took a direct turn eastward,
by which we knew that we were on the
direct road to Darien. Two miles further on,
we suddenly came upon some houses. Men and
women were passing almost within hailing distance;
but caution forbade us revealing ourselves,
and so we attempted to regain the
swampy thicket. On our way thither, we passed
a field in which were a number of geese; and
so strong was the temptation to ascertain
whether goose was as palatable as frog, that we
halted, and concealing ourselves, wearily awaited
the fall of night, intending to make a foray by
starlight. But by four o’clock a heavy thunderstorm
came up; and dreading to be again wet,
we made our way to an old waste-house near by
where, shortly, much to our surprise, in came
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
two men, one rather old, and the other young.
They inquired where we were from. Collins,
whose fictitious name was Compton, told them
that we lived in Pulaski county, Georgia; that
we had been driven by the Yankees from Darien,
and were now on our way home. We
were in a hurry to get there before the conscripts
left for the seat of war, in order that we
might go with our own boys.</p>

<p>This they thought was all true; and when the
rain ceased, we kept up the deception by walking
along the road with them. They soon after
struck off into a by-road, and when we had gone
a little further on, and thought ourselves safe,
we turned our footsteps back towards Darien.
Just as we turned, we were hailed by a man all
clothed in rags, whose appearance indicated that
he might have been hiding in the swamp for
months. He quickly joined us, and entered
into conversation. He opposed the war violently;
and judging from this that he was merely
acting a part, I determined to be “secesh.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand,” said he, “this tarnal
war!”</p>

<p>“Why! you’re not a Yankee, are you?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” he replied; “but I don’t understand
it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why,” resumed I, “don’t you know that
the Yankees are coming down here to free
our negroes?”</p>

<p>“Darn the tarnal niggers!” was the rejoinder;
“I ain’t got any.”</p>

<p>“But they will confiscate our land.”</p>

<p>“Well, I haven’t got no land, so they can’t
hurt me. Another thing, they say they’re
fighting for the old flag we all loved.”</p>

<p>Rallying myself, I answered:</p>

<p>“They’re all abolitionists; and if you and I
don’t fight, these negroes will be freed among
us.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, gentlemen,” said our new companion,
“if you’ll hear me a minute, without
getting mad, I’ll tell you all about my case. I’m
a conscript, and I’ve got to go soldiering for
eleven dollars a month. If I’d get a jean like
that of yours”&mdash;pointing to an old cotton coat
that I wore&mdash;“I’d have to pay eleven dollars a
yard for it. These shoes I’ve got on cost ten
dollars; corn-meal is two dollars and fifty cents
per bushel, and salt one dollar per pound. Now,
how in the d&mdash;&mdash;l can a man soldier under
them circumstances?”</p>

<p>I felt myself completely beaten; but still
fearing a catch somewhere, I resolved to try the
fellow again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, you’re a regular-built Yankee!” I
exclaimed, “and ought to be taken up, and if I
had my way, you would be.”</p>

<p>At this he changed the subject, and we told
him the Pulaski county story. He then invited
us to his house to get something to eat, to
which, of course, we had to consent. While
there enjoying our meal, which consisted of corn-bread
and sour milk, and watching him closely
all the time, in marched fifteen conscripts.
They immediately seized the master of the
house, and put him under a heavy guard.
Here was a new dilemma, and I winked at my
comrade to answer all questions, as I was fearful
that if both of us undertook the task, some
fatal mistake might occur. He did so, and
succeeded remarkably well, for he was shrewd
and quick at perception. I stood carelessly by
the fire, drying the only stocking I had, and
playing the idiot to what I thought perfection.
The intruders were dressed savagely, their
heads being covered with rudely-made caps of
coon-skin, the tail of the animal hanging down
their backs. Several of them were eating the
clay which has so often been noticed by travellers
in the South.</p>

<p>These miserable creatures despatched one of
their number on a jenny, who shortly after
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
returned, bringing with him the “squire,” a
long, lanky, knock-kneed man, with hollow
eyes and lantern jaws. He had a law-book
tucked under his arm, to give weight, I suppose,
to his appearance. This dignitary (?) stepped
to me, and began questioning me with much
official haughtiness, in fact so offensively, that
I became enraged at last, and throwing off my
assumed character of an idiot, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Who <i>are you</i>?”</p>

<p>“I’m the <i>squiah</i>, sir, the <i>squiah</i>!” he replied,
in his half negro dialect, and in exceedingly
pompous tones.</p>

<p>“Well,” said I, “the people who made a
squire of you must have been very short of
material. But, sir squire, what is your business
here?”</p>

<p>“To hold a trial over <i>you</i>; that thar’s my
bis’nis here.”</p>

<p>I looked the ignoramus sternly in the face,
as I rejoined:</p>

<p>“Well, sir, if you undertake to ‘<i>hold a trial</i>’
over Pulaski county citizens, we’ll make you
smoke for it.”</p>

<p>My determined manner nonplussed him considerably,
and turning to a companion, who
seemed to be a conscripting officer, he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t want nuthin’ to do with these yer
tarnal fellers, fur they know ’emselves, I golly!”</p>

<p>The conscripting officer, however, was not so
easily turned aside, for failing to induce the
“<i>squire</i> to hold a trial on us,” he sent a message
to the deputy sheriff, and that high functionary
came promptly to the rescue of the “Confederacy,”
and arrested us. The squire having thus
shifted this responsibility, regained his courage,
and said to us, fiercely:</p>

<p>“Now, then, you’re arrested, and you’ve got
ter tell us who you are, and whar from.”</p>

<p>“Ah! we’re prisoners now, and you may find
out all you want to know if you can,” was our
reply.</p>

<p>We were forthwith searched, the result of
which was the finding of a slip of paper in one
of my pockets with “<i>Mess No. 44</i>” written on
it. Not one of our captors could read; and
when I asked for a written copy of the charges
against us, they were completely dumbfounded.
The “squire,” with a kind of glorification in
his tones, said:</p>

<p>“A bill, you tarnal fool! I can’t write, I
golly!”</p>

<p>My comrade was asked if he could read and
write, and on his saying yes, the card was
handed to him to decipher. The crowd clustered
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
around, and when he assisted them in
spelling out the word upon it, one cute fellow
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Meeser! Meeser! that’s it!”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s it,” bawled another, who had
thrown himself on a bed; “Mr. Meeser, I golly!
John Meeser, what lives up in Pulaski county,
and keeps a grocery, and sells good whiskey, I
golly.”</p>

<p>Here was our salvation; and starting forward,
I harangued my wondering auditors with all
the eloquence at my command, appealing, and
threatening, and reasoning by turns. The
result was that we were acquitted, the “squire”
himself announcing it in the following laconic
style:</p>

<p>“You’re clar, I golly!”</p>

<p>The night setting in with a heavy storm of
rain, again we were all compelled to remain in
the house together. We, ourselves, pretended
to sleep, and heard the rebels several times remark:</p>

<p>“How sound these men sleep! None but innocent
men could sleep that way.”</p>

<p>Shortly after midnight, we made an attempt
to escape, but, opening the wrong door, we
found ourselves in another room, which was
tenanted by some of the conscripts. In an
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
instant all were awake, and we were once more
seized. Several of them accused us of being
devilish Yankees, and urged hanging as the
best course to pursue. Others of them still believed
us to be what we had represented ourselves.
This division of opinion resulted in
the deputy sheriff ordering us to be taken from
the house under a guard of six men with loaded
muskets. He followed us out, telling us as we
walked along, that we must go into close confinement.
We could not realize what he meant,
but we soon learned, for within ten minutes we
were chained together with a huge chain. One
end was twined round my neck, and secured
with a large padlock, while the other end was
placed in like manner about Collins’ neck.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="chain">

“One end of the chain was twined round my neck, and
secured with a large padlock, while the other end was placed in like

</div>
</div>

<p>There, in the midst of ruthless foes, a thousand
miles away from home and its endearments,
we stood wet, ragged, and forlorn; chained, yes,
chained together, like felons, like oxen, like
wild beasts. Had it not been for the comforting
spirit of God, I am certain that I should have
sunk at this juncture with despair; for in fancy
I could see my wife and my little ones in their
peaceful cottage, fondly asking when the absent
loved one would return. “Ah!” thought I,
“when, indeed, shall I be joined to you once
more, darlings? Shall it be on this earth, or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
shall it be in that better land where man’s inhumanity
to man makes no one mourn?”</p>

<p>In the morning, our merciless captors, forming
on either side of us, and also in our rear,
forced us to march forward. My wounded foot
and hand pained me very much, and it was with
the utmost difficulty that I could walk. The
disparity, also, in the height of my comrade and
myself&mdash;I being much taller than he&mdash;caused
me to give him a severe jerk at every step. So
fatigued and dispirited did we at last become,
that we threw ourselves down, and refused to
go any further. At this our captors threatened
to shoot us. We were not to be intimidated thus,
however, and the ruffians were at last obliged
to obtain a rickety old wagon, in which we were
carried some distance. After traveling forty-five
or fifty miles, we arrived at the town of
Jackson, Georgia, where the people had already
heard of our approach. On reaching the place,
we were allowed to seat ourselves on a Captain
Smith’s porch, until a court could be convened
for our trial. The jury was composed almost
entirely of old men, and while they were preparing
for their assumed duties, our guards
were off trying to hunt up some whiskey. But
the latter article was worth eight dollars a
pint, their efforts were not likely to meet with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
much success. This was fortunate for us, as, if
they should obtain enough of the vile compound
to intoxicate themselves, they would
most likely kill us on their return.</p>

<p>The court soon being prepared to proceed, I
was the first arraigned. We had resolved to
tell the truth concerning ourselves, no matter
whether we should die for it or not, and so I
addressed the court as follows:</p>

<p>“May it please the court, I was born in Rockbridge
county, Virginia, but early in life removed
with my father to Ohio, and settled in
Shelby county, where he raised his family of
six sons and three daughters. Of this family,
I am the youngest member, except one. Early
in life I commenced a public career, which I
followed until I heard of the bombardment of
Fort Sumpter&mdash;until I heard that a league of
men, banded together for the express purpose
of destroying the best government on God’s
earth,&mdash;had dragged our glorious old banner
down into the dust, and trampled it beneath
their feet, and finally fired it from a cannon’s
mouth, in order that no vestige of it might remain.
Then I remembered that my grandsire
had fought under that holy banner at Bunker
Hill; that he was present on the field, when
Molly Pitcher, stripping the uniform from the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
stiffening limbs of her dying husband, assumed
his command, and drove the enemy back. I
also remembered that, in 1812, my father,
leaving at home all his loved ones, took the
field in defence of the Stars and Stripes. I
have heard my mother say&mdash;God bless her! she
is now in heaven&mdash;that her husband and six
brothers were in the army at the same time.
Now, gentlemen, do not think I will waive any
part of the facts in the case. The son of pious
parents, I was always taught to speak nothing
save the truth; but, on the day we were arrested
by these gentlemen, if I dare call them
such, I gave my first denial of the positive
truth. We both endeavored to deceive you.
And why? Because we knew that our lives
were not safe, if you should learn who we really
were.”</p>

<p>(Here a voice said, “No, by golly, they’re
not safe, <i>now</i>!”)</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, be that as it may,” continued I,
“I will speak my last words with courage, and
they shall be truthful words. When this war
broke out, I was engaged at my profession in
Cincinnati, Ohio; but I felt, and I avowed it at
Heaven’s altar, that I could be nothing else than
a United States soldier. I accordingly volunteered
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
to join my loyal countrymen already in
the field.</p>

<p>“On March 4th, we left Paducah, Kentucky,
and on the 13th, we landed on Pittsburg Hill. I
contended with all my heart and might against
Beauregard’s skirmishers for several days; but
I was finally overpowered by numbers, captured,
and taken to Corinth. From there I was taken
to Columbus, Mississippi, from there to Montgomery,
Alabama, and from thence to Macon,
Georgia. On the night of June 18th, in company
with my comrade, I broke from the
guard-house at the latter place, ran your guard-lines,
and escaped. Since then we have been
fed and assisted by your negroes, until now we
are in your power.</p>

<p>“In conclusion, gentlemen, I would say,
shoot me, hang me, cut my throat, kill me in
any way you please. But, know you, that in
so doing, you kill a United States soldier, who
glories in these chains!” I shook my chains as
I finished.</p>

<p>In an instant there was an uproar, some demanding
that our chains should be removed,
and others swearing that they should not. The
matter was settled by the sheriff, however, who,
on receiving our word that we would give him
no trouble, freed us from the disgusting bonds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>This change of our fortune was as sudden as
it was unexpected. We enjoyed supper with
Captain Smith, having finished which, we found
the deputy sheriff ready, with a team of splendid
horses, to convey us to his own residence, some
two miles from town. We were not long in
ascertaining that the sheriff was a Western
Virginia man, and that his sympathies were
with the United States government. He informed
us that Captain Smith was under bonds
for ten thousand dollars for his good behavior.
From the Captain we got the story of the men
who followed us in the sweet-potato patch on
the same day we came to the old church, of
which I have before spoken.</p>

<p>In the course of their pursuit they had
stopped at the Captain’s door, and inquired of
him if two men, answering our descriptions,
had passed that way lately. Thinking at the
moment of the old church, and wishing to test
their bravery, he informed them that he believed
they would find us there. He took care to add,
however, that the building was haunted, and
that from out of the graves which surrounded
it, they would see men rising without heads.
One and another at this exclaimed against
going on an errand fraught with such danger
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
from spirits, and we were thereby saved from
capture, at least at that time.</p>

<p>After hinting to us the sentiments of Captain
Smith and himself, the sheriff invited us to his
house. It was constructed of rough pine logs,
but scrupulously clean and neat in all its arrangements.
We also saw his negroes’ quarters,
and they were nearly as good as his own house.
As we passed along on our way to inspect a
field of sugar-cane, we were amused to see the
slaves peeping at us from behind the corners of
their cabins.</p>

<p>Our friend next furnished us with water,
soap, towels, and a razor, and going into the
sugar-house, we cleaned ourselves. This expression
may seem rather strong to delicate
ears, but it is the only term which even faintly
describes our task. We at once commenced
hostilities, scraping rebel mud, wood-ticks, and
body-guards from our skins. The contest
lasted for over two hours and a half, we proving
entirely victorious.</p>

<p>When it was dark, we heard the same old
song that we had heard before, when the negroes
were coming from their work. As I sauntered
down a lane near by, words of prayer fell upon
my ears, and a little investigation discovered
to me a female slave down on her knees in her
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
lowly hut, asking God to bless and preserve
her husband, who was to be parted from her
and sold to a new master. What Christian
meekness, resignation, and faith in God’s power,
did this poor creature manifest in her words of
petition! and the lines sprang into my mind:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Christian men have bought and sold me,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Paid my price in paltry gold;</div>
<div class="verse">But, though slave they have enrolled me,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Minds are never to be sold.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Her prayer comforted her, and rising from
her knees, she began to sing “the song of
David.”</p>

<p class="noindent">As the words of inspiration came to my ears, I, too,
sank on my knees, and poured forth my soul at the mercy-seat. I must
have spoken rather loudly, for the next morning, this identical slave
woman, while dressing my wounded foot, asked me to what church I
belonged. On my telling her, she sprang away quickly, and ran and
informed her mistress that I was a minister of their church. The lady
immediately came to me, her face wreathed in sweet smiles, and inquired
if such was really the case. I told her it was, and had been so since my
seventeenth year.</p>

<p>“Oh! sir,” she answered, “my husband is a
member of that church.”</p>

<p>At this moment breakfast was announced, and
after the conclusion of the meal, I was requested
by both the sheriff and his wife, to lead in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
prayer. The Lord put words into my mouth,
and we had, indeed, a happy time. My host
then invited me to take a walk with him, which
I did, though my foot gave me considerable
pain. We fell immediately to conversation, in
the course of which I got a full insight into the
real condition of affairs in the Southern Confederacy.</p>

<p>To one of my questions, he answered:</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, the war is the cause of all our
misery. You see, for instance, this region of
country is adapted only to raising cotton, for
the land is too light for sugar-cane or rice. The
masses of the people in this particular county
are employed in cutting timber, which, being
floated down the Ocmulgee to Darien, is sold
there, and with the proceeds are obtained the
necessaries of life, flour, corn-meal, salt, &amp;c.”</p>

<p>“Well,” suggested I, “you rich men, at
least, will not suffer.”</p>

<p>“There, sir, you are much mistaken. We
shall suffer heavily; for, though we have farms
and plantations, yet we have not hands to work
them. And another thing, perhaps, you are
not aware of, is, that we have thousands of poor
men who live here and there, in their pole-huts,
rearing large families on the little crops of cotton
and so forth, which they raise on some other
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
man’s farm, upon which they have squatted.
In the fall they hunt, and thus supply their
families with meat and salt; the skins of the
animals they take to procure the latter article.
So they live, half human, half animal, letting
their progeny loose upon us. Of course, many
of them must starve now. If they could obtain
salt, however, they might live on gophers,
which abound in the pine-forests.”</p>

<p>Presently, we came in sight of a wretched
hut, about which I saw some white children
playing. My companion led me thither, with
the remark:</p>

<p>“I will show you, sir, a family belonging to
the class of which I speak.”</p>

<p>Upon reaching the hut, my blood almost
chilled at the sight of squalid poverty which I
beheld. There stood a family of ten persons;
a father&mdash;who on account of his age had escaped
the conscription&mdash;a mother, and eight ragged,
filthy children. The ages of the latter, I should
judge, ranged from one year up to sixteen. The
peculiar color of their complexions struck me
very forcibly; it was the same as that of the
men composing the first court by which I had
been tried. My host gave us a reason for it,
that “they laid around so much in the dirt, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
<i>ate so much clay</i>.” I asked the man himself
why he and his family ate clay.</p>

<p>“Cause it’s good, I golly!” was the prompt
reply.</p>

<p>“Well, how are you getting along?”</p>

<p>“Bad enough,” said he, “fur we hain’t had a
grain o’ salt in the house fur more’n four
months, only as the sheriff here gins it to us.”</p>

<p>“What do you live on, then?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, on gophers and corn-meal, now-a-days.
But, I golly! our meal’s out, and I don’t know
what we’ll do next.”</p>

<p>I got this miserable creature to make me a
pair of slippers from old boots, for which I paid
him one dollar and fifty cents, in order that he
might get some corn-meal, which sold at two
dollars and fifty cents per bushel. This money
was part of a sum that the sheriff had kindly
lent me. Before we took our departure, the
lady (?) of the hut gave us her opinion, in no
measured terms, of the rascally Yankees.</p>

<p>“Ah, sir,” said the sheriff, when we were out
of hearing, “if I were to speak the real sentiments
of my mind, I should be hung before
twenty-four hours. I am a Union man, and
when you get back to Ohio, I want you to tell
all the friends in our Church that I am so. I
have twenty-seven negroes, and a thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
acres of land, and I would let the whole of it go,
could I only see the Union restored to what it
once was. But this I never expect to behold,
for while slavery exists, the Union cannot be
preserved. I am in reality an anti-slavery man,
and these are my reasons therefor: First, it is
a sin in the sight of God; secondly, it is an injury
to the slave himself; and thirdly, it is an
injury to the white race.”</p>

<p>“How so?” asked I.</p>

<p>“Because land worked by slave labor is not
worth half so much as when worked by free
labor. And, besides, if it were not for slavery,
society would be much improved, for the rich
and poor, as things are now, are very ignorant.”</p>

<p>“How do the rich obtain their wealth?”
said I.</p>

<p>“In this way. A man comes here, perhaps,
with one female slave, and, in a comparatively
short time, he has quite a number of young
servants about him. Some of these he sells,
and with the proceeds purchases a piece of
timber-land. This he has cleared, sells the
timber, gets more slaves and another piece of
land, and so goes on adding to his wealth continually.
He has no education himself, and,
three times out of four, gives his children none.”</p>

<p>My host further informed me that he himself
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
had three hundred acres of land in Illinois, and
that he had intended to send his son to that State
to be educated, but he supposed he would be unable
to do so now. He said he had no doubt
that this Illinois property would be confiscated.
“But,” added he, warmly, “I do not care if it
is, provided the Union is restored!”</p>

<p>The sentiments expressed by this man astonished
me, and I could not forbear asking him
the reason why he opposed slavery so earnestly,
and yet held in bondage twenty-seven human
beings.</p>

<p>“I never bought nor sold a slave in my life!”
said he. “You saw that old negress, Kate, this
morning; well, she belonged to my wife, as did
also her two sisters. These other slaves are all
their children. I would have freed them long
ago, but they refused to leave me; and I, on
the other hand, could not leave them to go
North, for I would have been obliged to give security
that they would not become a pest and
burden to the community, and that I was unable
to do. So, you see how the case stands.
But I am not alone in my sentiments, sir.
There are thirty-five of us within an area of ten
miles, who have organized themselves into a society,
and hold regular meeting every two
weeks, to oppose the conscription. This is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
confidential, for I know I can trust you.” He spoke
of the notice which had been taken by Northern
journals of the existence of such societies in
the South, and referred to the <i>disunion</i> associations
in the North. I informed him that the
latter, thank God, were few and far between,
and could do no harm to the cause.</p>

<p>This gentleman’s statement concerning the
depreciation of Southern land, brought to my
mind the authority of the fathers of our Republic
on the subject. John Sinclair had
written to Washington concerning the difference
of the land in Pennsylvania from that of
Virginia and Maryland. Washington’s answer
was this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Because there are in Pennsylvania laws for
the gradual <i>abolition of slavery</i>, which neither
Maryland nor Virginia has at present; but
there is nothing more certain than that they
must have, and at a period not remote.”</p>
</div>

<p>The sheriff’s statement regarding the liberation
of his slaves, was the same as that of John
Randolph, Governor of Virginia. The latter
said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“The deplorable error of our ancestors in
copying a civil institution from savage Africa,
has affixed to their posterity a depressing
burden, which nothing but the extraordinary
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
benefits conferred by our happy climate could
have enabled us to support. We have been far
outstripped by States to whom nature has been
far less bountiful. It is painful to consider
what might have been, under other circumstances,
the amount of general wealth in Virginia,
or the whole sum of comfortable
subsistence and happiness possessed by all her
inhabitants.”&mdash;<i>Addressed to the Legislature of
Virginia</i>, 1820.</p>
</div>

<p>In the course of a conversation I had with
the old slave woman, Kate, I said:</p>

<p>“Aunt Katy, if the slaves were to be freed,
it would not do you much good, for you are
old, and will soon pass into eternity.”</p>

<p>“Thank de Lord, sah,” she replied, “I am
ready to go! But, oh! I wish I could only see
my children and grandchildren in hope of
freedom! And dar’s my husband. You see his
massa might sell him, and den I don’t think I
could live. Dar’s no danger of <i>my</i> massa
selling me, for he’s a good man, and he’s let me
and my children learn to read, and I learned
my husband.”</p>

<p>“What is the law in Georgia on that point?”
I asked.</p>

<p>“God bless you, sah! they’d penitentiary a
man for learning a slave to read.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>This I had heard before, but never until now
did I give it credence. Aunt Katy told me she
was sorry we had not struck that town before
in our flight, as her son was an operator on the
Underground Railroad, and would have insured
our escape.</p>

<p>Evening came, and once more did I lead in
prayer at family worship. I did so with more
assurance and faith than the evening before, for
I now thoroughly knew the sheriff’s sentiments.
Had I not known them, I must confess that my
faith in his religion would have been greatly
weakened. Do not tell me of republican or
mutual rights, or Christianity, when the soul is
full of tyranny.</p>

<p class="poet">The Horrors of Slavery.</p>

<p>There are a few weak-kneed politicians in the
North, who think to curry favor with the South
at this time, by exclaiming, that “we love
slavery, and that the negroes were made for
slaves.” Did they but know the opinion of
Union men in the South, their hopes for popularity
would be for ever blighted.</p>

<p>After our devotions were ended, conversation
on the current topics of the day was resumed.
The sheriff expressed the hope that he would
soon hear of the arrests of all in the North who
were opposed to a vigorous prosecution of the
war. This converse we continued until bedtime,
when, again joining in a supplication to the
Throne of Grace, we retired for the night. But
sleep was a stranger to my eyes, for my foot
and hand, although Aunt Katy had dressed
them skilfully, gave me excessive pain. As I
lay writhing on my couch, I was unable to banish
the thoughts that came flashing into my
mind concerning the bondmen of the South;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
and I pondered deeply whether I could not do
something toward benefitting them. Yet when
such men as Washington and Jefferson failed,
how should I succeed?</p>

<p>“But,” exclaims the tender-footed Union
man, “you would not intimate that Washington
was an abolitionist?”</p>

<p>To such an one I would say, “Hear the
words of that great and good man.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“The benevolence of your heart, my dear
Marquis, is so conspicuous on all occasions, that I
never wonder at fresh proofs of it. But your
late purchase of an estate in the colony of Cayenne,
with a view of emancipating the slave, is
a generous and noble proof of your humanity.
Would to God a like spirit might diffuse itself
generally among the minds of the people of
this country! But I despair of seeing it.
Some petitions were presented to the Assembly,
at its last session, for the abolition of slavery,
but they scarcely obtained a hearing.”&mdash;<i>Letter
to Lafayette.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Rising early the next morning, I walked
abroad to view the works of God; and as I
limped along, I thanked him exceedingly for
his goodness and kindness to me, his unworthy
servant. As I passed the cabins of the sheriff’s
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
slaves, they were preparing to go up to his
house for prayers.</p>

<p>After breakfast, our host, taking us aside,
informed us that as we had been committed to
his charge, he would be obliged to return us to
Macon, where he would get the commandant to
parole us, limiting us at the same time to the
boundaries of the State. Had he himself come
across us accidentally, he assured us that, instead
of holding us, he would have had us
conveyed secretly to our lines. But this, under
the circumstances, he was now unable to do,
as he would thereby incur the death-penalty
himself. We, of course, assented to this, as it
would have been extremely ungrateful to our
host, who had protected us from violence, to
refuse.</p>

Wealthy Planter.</p>

<p class="noindent">During the day, I walked out into the pines
that I might be alone with my thoughts; and
there in the solitude I mused upon all the
knowledge that I had gained from my host,
and also from my previous experience. Oh!
thought I, if our people at the North were
permitted to look into the hearts of the better
class in the South, there they would see nothing
but opposition to the great sin of slavery.
Could they but see the South as I have seen it,
they would come to the same conclusions as
myself, viz., that there are three distinct classes
or castes. First, there are the clay-eaters, or
common mass of the people, upon whom even
the negroes look down with contempt. Second,
there is the middle class, in which we find all
those who sympathize with the North in this
war. Lastly, we have the slave-owning aristocracy,
haughty, supercilious and powerful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>Our host belonged to the middle class, and
on being questioned why that class held the
peculiar position it did in regard to the rebellion,
he replied:</p>

<p>“We know that the very moment they&mdash;the
aristocracy&mdash;succeed in forming a Confederacy,
they will, of necessity, keep a large standing
army. Into this army they will force the sons
of the poorest class, or clay-eaters, while they
themselves, having negroes to do all their labor,
will have full control of affairs. Then assuming
all the lucrative offices for themselves, they
will force us in reality to support them.</p>

<p>“You may ask why we do not educate the
poor whites, and thus set at work a force that
would destroy the power of the aristocracy.
We would willingly do so, but for the fact that
they are so stubborn, ignorant, and bigoted,
that any attempt of such a nature would be
termed <i>abolition</i>, and you might, with far more
safety, call a man a thief or murderer than call
him an <i>abolitionist</i>.</p>

<p>“Should the Confederacy succeed, too, there
will be another danger, which will require all
the power of the government to combat, and
that is the insurrection of the slaves. The
latter are, almost to a unit, expecting their
liberty by reason of this war, and are at present
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
quietly awaiting such a result. Should it unfortunately
turn out, however, that the rebellion
succeeds, then they will doubtless strike a blow
for themselves; and may Heaven spare me from
witnessing the terrible scenes which must follow.”</p>

<p>Showing me his hand, which I noticed had
been wounded at some former time, the speaker
added:</p>

<p>“That wound I received in the following
manner. It will serve to show what harsh
measures have already been resorted to for
preventing any rise of the slaves. I used to
allow my servants to hold prayer-meetings
sometimes in the house; and on one occasion a
patroller came to the house while one of their
meetings was in progress, and summarily proceeded
to break it up. I interfered, when,
turning upon me, he struck me a fearful blow
with his weapon, breaking my fingers as you
see. I instantly shot him. Since then I have
been obliged not to allow the meetings.”</p>

<p>In my own mind, I could but compare this
noble gentleman to many half-hearted Christians
in the North, who would assist in perpetuating
the curse of slavery on the ground of policy.
Shame on such false Christians and hypocrites!
They would call themselves democrats of the
nineteenth century. They would say they were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
on the side of Washington and Adams, and all
the fathers. But they are not, for Washington
was not in his heart a slaveholder, as the following
extract from a letter written by him is
sufficient to prove:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I hope,” writes he, “it will not be conceived
from these observations that it is in my heart
to hold the unhappy people, who are the subject
of this letter, in slavery. I can only say,
there is not a man living who wishes more
sincerely than I do to see a plan adopted for
the abolition of it.”</p>
</div>

<p>Reader, you may, perhaps, complain or disapprove
of my digressions from the subject of
my own perils and adventures to that of slavery;
but, so long as God blesses me with thoughts
and words, so long will I continue to strike at
the wicked, man-degrading institution, with
all my heart, with all my soul, and with all my
might. Slavery is the baneful Upas that overshadows
our glorious Republic, and its deadly
exhalations must in time destroy us, unless we
cut it down, tear it out by the roots, and completely
annihilate it now and for ever. I, with
the great founders of the Republic, hold these
to be self-evident truths: “That all men are
created free and equal; that they are endowed
by their Creator with certain inalienable rights:
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness. That, to secure these rights,
governments are instituted among men, deriving
their powers from the just consent of the
governed,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>But to return to my theme. When, after
passing through innumerable hardships and
perils, being imprisoned in Columbus, Mobile,
Montgomery, and Macon, and spending twenty-one
weary days in the dismal swamps and pine-woods
of Georgia, I reached the home of the
sheriff, I, like Paul the apostle, thanked God
and took courage.</p>

<p>As soon as practicable we set out for Macon,
and while memory holds a place in my being, I
can never forget the parting of ourselves and the
kind family by whom we had been so befriended.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, gentlemen,” said the lady of the
house, her eyes suffused with tears; “and should
we never meet again on earth, we shall, perhaps,
in that better land, where all is love and peace.”</p>

<p>There was such a sincerity in the fair speaker’s
tones, that I could not repress the tears
that her words brought to my eyes. The servants,
too, clustered around us, and in their intelligent
countenances I could discern that they
appreciated all that was going on. A final
shaking of hands, an adieu, and we were off.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
Our buggy bore us quickly out of sight of the
house, and I must acknowledge, prisoner as I
was, that there was a pang in my heart at the
moment. And here a thought suggests itself.
The reader has, doubtless, often thought, after
reading the various and conflicting accounts of
returned prisoners, how strange it was that they
could so differ. Now, their treatment depended
entirely upon their own conduct, and the class
of people among whom the chances of war
threw them. It was very rarely that any one
expressing his opinions against the Southern
system as boldly as I did, met, upon the whole,
with such good fortune. Those who fared well
were semi-secessionists. I will give a case in
point:</p>

<p>At Columbus, Mississippi, there was a man
from Illinois, who stated that he was a quarter-master
in a cavalry regiment. He was an ardent
pro-slavery man, and whenever the subject
came up, he defended the right of the
South to hold slaves, and became enraged if
that right was assailed by any of his companions.
This man took the trip with us through
Mobile, Montgomery, and Macon, and was continually
receiving favors that were denied to
the rest. While in Macon, he was appointed
prison quarter-master; was permitted to run at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
large, and he used the privilege to post the secessionists
in everything that was favorable to
them. This man will be referred to again ere I
close this narrative.</p>

<p>We were to go by land to Hockinsville,
where we were to take the cars. We traveled
slowly, in order, as the sheriff remarked, that
we might really see the destitute condition of
the country through which we passed. We stopped
at a place where a deer had just been killed,
and obtained some fresh venison. The man
from whom we got the meat, was from Eastern
Maryland, and, while conversing with him, I
found that he had some knowledge of the disunion
men of the Methodist Episcopal Church.
He was deeply opposed to the separation, but
at the same time, candidly admitted that the
North had sufficient cause therefor. Still he
thought that it would have been far better to
remain united, and endeavor to reform the pro-slavery
portion.</p>

<p>“I and this gentleman,” said he, turning to
the sheriff, “have stood up for our faith comparatively
alone, until the outbreak of the war.
Since that, we have been joined by several
more, but we are crushed, and dare not speak
what we think. If we did, we should be hung
to the first tree that could hold us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>He persistently contended that it was a very
unfortunate thing that the Church had divided,
urging that it led to a division of the government.
I held not much further argument with
him on this subject, as anti-slavery men of his
class were very unpopular in Ohio when I left
there.</p>

<p>At evening we seated ourselves on the porch
of this man’s cottage, and began conversing
with the family, the subject being changed of
course.</p>

<p>The majority of the residents in this county
held the same opinions as these two. I would
like to give the names of these gentlemen, but
as they might possibly get into some of those
traitorous Northern papers which circulate in
the South, and thereby bring them into trouble,
I am constrained to suppress them.</p>

<p>We remained at this house all night, and
bidding our new friends farewell, started the
next morning on our way. We kept the Darien
road, which I could recognize by the descriptions
given of it by the negroes. Our next
stopping-place was far from agreeable, for every
one in it was a strong secessionist&mdash;so strong
indeed, that, when they found out our characters,
they did not object to the sheriff having anything
he wanted, but not with us. The keeper
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
of the house at which we were, cursed fearfully,
they utterly refused to give us anything to eat,
swearing that the d&mdash;&mdash;d Yankees shouldn’t
have a morsel of food. The sheriff, however,
pacified him at last by telling him that I was
from Virginia, and that, although I was in the
Yankee army, still I was as pro-slavery a man
as himself. This made matters a little better,
and the surly host proceeded to question me. I
baffled him, however, by saying:</p>

<p>“What paper do you take?”</p>

<p>“We don’t take none,” said he, “fur I can’t
read. Have you ever been in a fight?” he
quickly added to his reply. I answered in the
affirmative.</p>

<p>“Have you ever seed a gunboat?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I rejoined.</p>

<p>He then became much interested, and was
not satisfied until I had given him a long
description of a gunboat, its object, and its
powers.</p>

<p>At this juncture five villainous-looking men
entered the room, and calling to my listener,
took him outside. When the sheriff saw this,
he turned rather pale, fearing that some violence
was threatened. When he was about to leave
with us, he asked the landlord what his bill
was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, nothing! as you’re taking them d&mdash;&mdash;d
Yankees to justice,” was the reply.</p>

<p>Though by no means complimentary, this
expression took a heavy load off our minds,
and we were comparatively light-hearted when
we took our departure.</p>

<p>The sheriff resolved not to halt again until
he reached a place where he was known, as he
feared that otherwise we might be mobbed.
By rapid driving he reached this point. Drawing
up before the door of a tavern, we immediately
dismounted, and were invited to enter by
a house-servant, who led us to a small fire at
which we might warm ourselves. As we sat
there, a hard-looking female came in, and seeing
my hand bound up, asked me what ailed it. I
responded that I had caught cold in an old
bruise which had assumed somewhat the character
of a felon. She inquired if she could do
anything for it. I thanked her, and told her
that I had a poultice of sweet gum on it.</p>

<p>We were presently shown up to our chamber,
and went to bed. My hand pained me so
much, however, that I could not sleep; and getting
up, I took a pan of water, and putting into
it a lump of opium, which I obtained from my
comrade, I laid my hand in it, and so passed the
remainder of the night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>We resumed our journey at an early hour,
and pressed forward in order to reach the railroad,
which was not quite finished to Hockinsville.
On the road we were compelled to stop
at the house of a man named Phillips. He was
very wealthy, owning over two hundred and
seventy-five slaves, and a fine plantation. He
was a bitter and unrelenting secessionist, and
therefore the sheriff thought it best not to mention
what or who we were. Our horses were
put up, and we entered the dwelling. Phillips
came in almost immediately after, and opened
a conversation about the war. The sheriff inquired
of him if he had any late papers.</p>

<p>“I don’t take no papers!” he rejoined; “I can’t
read. But,” added he, casting a glance at us,
“there was some men hunting round here the
other day for them Yankees that got away at
Macon, and I only wish they’d catch the thieves,
and shoot them!”</p>

<p>This was not pleasant to our ears, and the
disagreeable sensation was considerably increased,
as Phillips, nodding his head towards us,
asked the sheriff his errand to Macon with us.</p>

<p>Our friend hesitated a moment to reply, but
finally stated his mission. Phillips instantly
flew into a rage, and commenced to swear and
threaten dreadfully. The sheriff told him that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
I was a Virginian, and of like sentiments with
himself, and so forth, but it did not effect much.
Phillips spoke of the outrageous conduct of our
men, and Butler’s famous New Orleans Proclamation,
and swore, with a horrid oath, that if he
had his own way, he would shoot every Yankee
that was caught. I rose, and walked outside,
and was followed by Phillips, who seemed fearful
of trusting me near the negroes who were
hanging round the house, and in whose faces I
could see an expression that showed they fully
comprehended who we were.</p>

<p>Presently the sound of the approaching train
came gratefully to our ears. When it arrived,
however, we learned that it would make a stop
of an hour, as a number of conscripts were to
be put aboard. Fearing to remain longer in
Phillips’s house, we adjourned into the neighboring
pines to avoid the mob. One after another,
several wagons, loaded with conscripts,
drove up. These conscripts and their friends
had, by some means or other, heard of our arrest,
but did not know that we were the men.
They spoke favorably of us, however, and
were heartily endorsed by some old ladies who
had come hither with their sons, and who were
decidedly opposed to the conscription.</p>

in the Army&mdash;Meeting the Slave we Chased&mdash;Rebel Account
of our Pursuit&mdash;Interesting Advertisement&mdash;In
Jail Again&mdash;Captain Clay Crawford&mdash;Prison Fare&mdash;Rebel
Barbarities&mdash;Taking Comfort.</p>

<p class="noindent">In due time we took our places on the train,
and recommenced our journey. At the next
stopping-place, a man in rebel uniform approached
me, and said:</p>

<p>“I think I know you, sir.”</p>

<p>I made no reply, supposing his object was
merely to quarrel with me. He repeated his
remark, and still I refused to notice him. The
third time he spoke, he said:</p>

<p>“Your name is Rev. J. J. Geer, and you
come from Cincinnati, Ohio. You used to
preach there in the George street Methodist
Protestant Church. I am &mdash;&mdash;, who studied
medicine with Dr. Newton of that city.”</p>

<p>He extended his hand, and I instantly grasped
it, and shook it heartily. I would state his
name; but, for the same reason that I suppress
the sheriff’s, I must also omit his. Stepping
back to where he had set down a basket,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
my old acquaintance brought me some biscuits
and roast chicken. After this welcome gift had
been properly attended to, the donor introduced
me to his lady, who was a fine, intelligent-looking
person. Her husband then taking his seat
beside me, we fell into conversation, the chances
of being overheard being small, on account of
the noise made by the train. Said he to a question
of mine:</p>

<p>“I should never have taken any part in this
war, could I have helped myself. But when
the conscription law was passed, I knew there
was no chance for my escaping it, nor could I
remove with my family. If I remained, I must
go into the army as a private. This I could
not endure, and so I obtained an office.”</p>

<p>At this moment, the cars suddenly stopped,
and an officer attended by a guard, who must
have partially overheard the last portion of the
speaker’s remarks, ordered him to leave me, and
take a seat in another part of the car.</p>

<p>Presently, we reached a place where we were
detained three hours. While waiting here, the
master of that negro whom we chased in the
swamp, and whom I have before mentioned as
having a basket of corn strapped to his back,
stepped aboard of the train. He came forward
smiling, and, taking us by the hand, told us
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
what a fierce chase he had had after us. He then
asked us if he should call the negro in, and on
receiving an affirmative answer, did so.</p>

<p>I asked, with the permission of his master,
why he ran from us in the swamp.</p>

<p>“Kase, sah, I thought you wuz Tom Jimmer
son, an’ he said he’d shoot me if he ever had
a chance.”</p>

<p>This negro seemed excessively ignorant; but
this is a habit with them all, as a general thing,
when their masters are present.</p>

<p>“Where in the d&mdash;&mdash;l did you hide,” asked
the owner of this slave, “when we were after
you?”</p>

<p>“Where did you look?” queried I.</p>

<p>“Well,” said he, “when the boy came in and
told me that he had seen you in the swamp, I
went down to the soldiers who were hunting
you on the river, and put them on the lookout.
Then I returned and started out all the dogs in
the neighborhood. One of these, an old hound,
that belonged to Tom Brown, never before
failed to bring to us his game within a short
time after he took the tracks. In two hours,
sixteen of us, with the two negroes and the
hounds, were after you hot-footed. Not long
after we put the dogs on your track, they got
confused, and ran my own boy up to the house.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
I called them back, and in returning, Brown’s
old dog struck round a fence, as we thought, on
your track. He kept on the branch back of my
field, and there crossed and went up the creek,
with the whole pack at his heels. We followed
after, and found that he crossed the water again,
and came down the other side to where he
crossed the first time. There the scent was
lost, and the dogs gave it up. We hunted
round there till nearly night, and not finding
any one, went down to the river to guard it.
When we got there, the corporal advised me,
with six or eight others, to go up the river and
take another hunt; but, of course, it brought no
good.”</p>

<p>My comrade here informed the narrator how
we had been lying concealed under the palm-leaves,
and watching all their motions, at a
distance of not over a hundred yards or so.
This astonished him very much; so much so,
indeed, that he seemed to doubt it, until Collins
repeated to him the identical expressions used
on that occasion by himself, his companions,
and the soldiers. He then turned to the sheriff
and said with an oath:</p>

<p>“I’ve hunted bear, and deer, and fox, and
never failed; but these Yankees fooled me bad.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>The sheriff told him we were Virginians,
which seemed to relieve him, as he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Well, I thought Yankees couldn’t have so
much pluck.”</p>

<p>One fact he was rather curious about, and
that was, how we had thrown the bloodhounds
off our track so easily. But this knowledge,
which had been imparted to us by the negroes,
we refused to divulge.</p>

<p>“Well,” said he in conclusion, “I wish you
a long life; and if I had the say in it, I’d let
you go free, for you’re none of these d&mdash;&mdash;d
Yankees.”</p>

<p>At this moment the cars started, and he,
bidding us another good-bye, leaped off, and we
saw him no more.</p>

<p>Soon after this little incident, my friend, the
sheriff, got a paper which he handed to me. In
it I noticed an account of the recapture of Captain
Clay Crawford, who was in prison with us,
and had escaped at the same time, but had been
separated from us in the alarm of that occasion.
I read also an advertisement of one J. J. Geer,
described as follows: “Six feet and three-fourths
of an inch in height, black hair, and blue eyes.”
Lieutenant A. P. Collins was also named, but
without any description.</p>

<p>I knew instantly that I had been reported by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
the man that I mentioned in the beginning of
my narrative as having been a deceiver. He
had measured me in Columbus jail, Mississippi,
and, as I was in my bare feet at the time, this
measurement was short, as by all military
standards I always measured six feet two
inches.</p>

<p>There were other unpleasant items in this
paper, the principal one of which was that in
reference to McClellan’s retreat from before
Richmond.</p>

<p>In due season we arrived at the end of our
journey, Macon, Georgia. In conferring with
the sheriff on the subject of our future course, I
told him it would be best for his own safety to
take us to the prison as soon as possible. This
he did; and it was but a short time after, that
we were again face to face with the tyrant
Rylander. He sent us under a guard of four
men to our cells, where the jailor came and
robbed us of our money. He took also our
watches, which until now we had succeeded in
carrying. We were then heavily ironed, and
left in those filthy cells with only a little straw
to lie upon, and this full of odious vermin.</p>

<p>We ascertained that it was true concerning
Captain Clay Crawford’s recapture. He belonged
to a Missouri regiment, and was a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
genteel, manly comrade, never, like most of his
companions, jeering at religion or its advocates.
He was a graduate of West Point, and consequently
a man well versed in military matters.</p>

<p>Hearing of our return, Captain Crawford,
who was confined close to us, made himself
known, and a conversation was shortly opened.
We learned from him that he had succeeded in
making his escape at the same time we did,
dressed in a rebel uniform. Going boldly to the
Provost Marshal’s office, he passed himself off
for a Confederate officer, and obtained a pass to
Savannah, where he hoped to be able to get
aboard a United States gunboat. His knowledge
of the South and Southern officers, and
the fact that there was a Captain Crawford in
the rebel army, assisted him greatly. In one
or two places through which he passed, he was
in peril from Union sympathizers, who looked
upon him as an enemy. In all these localities
he found that all the young, able-bodied men
had been swept into the army, while the old
men who were left behind were very decided
Unionists. This I may add was exactly my
own experience.</p>

<p>I asked him what fare he got in prison.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said he, “nothing but corn-meal and
maggots!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>That he stated truth in regard to the food, I
had ample proof, when at night a negro brought
us some boiled colards, a species of cabbage.
He carried it in a dirty-looking bucket, mixed
with corn-bread, made of meal and water. Producing
two tin plates, he put a mess of the colards
on each, and then pushed them through the
grating of our cell to us. The greens appeared
to have been boiled with something like meat,
or rather scraps of refuse fat, certainly not fit
for anything save soap-grease. On close inspection
of the mess, we could see the maggots, which,
by way of curiosity, we commenced to pick out.
By the time we had picked out half a teaspoonful
of large fat ones&mdash;not skippers, but maggots&mdash;our
stomachs, hungry as they were, sickened,
and we could not touch the horrid food.</p>

<p>We then examined our haversacks and a
pillow-slip that old Aunt Kate had given us. In
the latter, as much to our gratification as surprise,
we found two fine roasted chickens, and
plenty of elegant corn bread made with molasses.
After enjoying this good fare, we knelt
and raised our voices in thanks to the Lord, who
still watched and guarded us. We felt very
happy, and made the misty old prison ring
again with our hymns of praise.</p>

<p>The night passed slowly, for my wounded
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
hand and foot pained me exceedingly. With
the return of daylight, conversation with Captain
Crawford was resumed, and we learned that
in his cell with him was a man named Rowley,
who was from Florida. He, like ourselves, had
attempted to pass the lines, but was recaptured
in the act.</p>

<p>Originally residing in Florida, taking no part
in the war, and attending quietly to his own
business, he had been suddenly arrested. The
circumstances thereof were as follows: “On the
night of August 20th, 1861, a party of ruffians
surrounded his dwelling, and without the
slightest warning, battered in the door, and
rushed into his house. So unexpected and so
fierce was the attack, that his wife, who was in
a delicate condition of health at the time, sank
swooning to the floor. The astonished husband,
not stopping to defend himself, sprang to the
assistance of his wife. While thus engaged,
his assailants seized him, and roughly binding
his hands behind him, dragged him from the
house, and mounted him upon a mule, which
they immediately drove off with them. When
thus ruthlessly torn from the bosom of his family,
he was looking forward with a husband’s
fond anxiety to the moment which was to make
him a father. And now, more than eleven
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
months had passed away, but he had never
heard any tidings of his family or property. He
owned several slaves. Whether his loving wife
had survived the shock she had received on the
night in question, or whether the angels of a
merciful God had carried her own soul, and
that one yet unborn, away to heaven, he did
not know.</p>

<p>His captors had taken him to a negro jail,
and cast him into a filthy cell, in which he laid
for three or four days, eating nor drinking
nothing. By this time, they deemed him sufficiently
reduced to become subservient to their
will. They accordingly took him from his cell,
and brought him to a man they styled “Colonel.”
By this man he was ordered to take a certain
oath. Upon his refusal, he was shown a rope
that had been used in the execution of four
of his neighbors, and he was informed that it
was still strong enough to hang him. The man
who held the rope strode toward him for the
purpose of placing it around his neck. Thus
convinced that there was something more than
menace meant, he attempted to reason with his
brutal captors, informing them that he was so
bewildered that he did not comprehend what
they wished him to do.</p>

<p>The person called Colonel thereupon ordered
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
him to be remanded to his cell. The next day,
hearing that the Union forces were approaching
them, they hurried their poor prisoner to Macon.</p>

<p>This man gave me accounts of the most
horrid scenes that he had witnessed. At one
period, he said that it was certain death for a
man to refuse to volunteer.</p>

<p>Our second day of imprisonment passed dully
enough, and indeed it would have been much
worse, but for the converse we held with
Captain Crawford and Mr. Rowley, whose principal
theme was the lightness of their rations.
Their allowance of corn-bread, for instance,
was a bit about one and a half inches square
twice a day. My wounds were exceedingly
painful, but I was obliged to suffer on without
obtaining any relief. Before I lay down for
the night, however, I comforted myself with
joining my comrade in singing those beautiful
lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“From every stormy wind that blows,</div>
<div class="verse">And every swelling tide of woe,</div>
<div class="verse">There is a calm, a safe retreat;</div>
<div class="verse">’Tis found beneath the mercy-seat.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>God’s blessing made us happy, and we could
exclaim with faith, “These chains will not
always hold us here.” How insignificant were
our sufferings when compared to those which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
had been endured by the followers of Christ in
ancient times! Again, while on our wretched
couches, we sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“My days are gliding swiftly by,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And I, a pilgrim stranger,</div>
<div class="verse">Would not detain them as they fly&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">These hours of toil and danger.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The next day I penned a letter to Major
Rylander, exhorting him, if he had any fear of
God before his eyes, or any spark of humanity
in his breast, to have me released from my
miserable cell, though it were to take me to
execution. I committed it to the care of a
negro, who was to convey it to the guard, who
in turn was to present it to Major Rylander.
Whether the latter ever received it, I never
knew, but certainly if he did, he never noticed
it.</p>

<p class="noindent">Night again found me still suffering, and still a
captive. The next day I heard from Captain
Crawford that the prayer which I put up that
evening to the Throne of Grace was rather
eccentric, very strong, and directed specially to
the case of our oppressive jailor. I suppose it
must have been rather so, for the jailor visited
me the next day. His house was in the prison yard
directly opposite my window.</p>

<p>Entering my cell, as I have said, he ordered
me to follow him. I did so, not knowing
what fate I was about to meet. When out of
hearing of my fellow-prisoners, he said:</p>

<p>“Who is that who prays in this prison every
night? It is you, I suspect.”</p>

<p>“I presume so,” replied I, “for it is my habit
to pray night and morning; for I am told in the

you are one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, now, there’s no use in fooling! Did
you pray for the Lord to kill me?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said I, “I prayed for the Lord to
convert you, or else kill you.”</p>

<p>“Well, you prayed for them fellows the Bible
speaks of,” he rejoined, referring to the Apostles
Paul and Silas.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s all one tarnal big lie!”</p>

<p>“Why, sir,” I inquired, “do you not believe
in the Bible?”</p>

<p>“No! I don’t believe one tarnal word of it, I
don’t.”</p>

<p>“Then, sir, if you escape the rod of God in
this life, you certainly will not in eternity.”</p>

<p>“See here, sir,” he rejoined angrily, “you
had better mind what you say.”</p>

<p>“I will speak my mind whenever it pleases me
to do so,” I said, looking the jailor directly in
the eye.</p>

<p>In this strain the conversation continued, till
at length he became so enraged, that, pushing
me violently back in my cell, he locked me fast
to a staple driven into the floor.</p>

<p>While lying thus, a negro came and gazed
intently at me, through the bars of the cell
door. This he repeated many times during the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
day, and at night I asked him if he belonged to
the jailor.</p>

<p>“No, sah,” said he, “I b’long to the richest
man in dis county.”</p>

<p>“What are you in here for?”</p>

<p>He dropped his voice almost to a whisper, as
he replied:</p>

<p>“Two white fellers came to my quarters one
night, and got me to go with ’em. Dey had dar
faces blacked all ober. Den dey crawled into a
winder whar dar wus some white gals, an’ de
gals dey hollered, an’ de two fellers dey runned,
an’ I runned arter ’em. But I didn’t know
what they’d done, an’ so I stopped, an’ de white
men what run arter all o’ us, cotched me, an’
brought me down here. Den dey chained me like
you is now, and den de white rascals what had
blacked ’emselves, dey runned off right away.
But dey won’t b’lieve a poor darkey. Now,
massa, Tom White, an’ he’s a white man, seed
dem white fellers what blacked dar faces, an’
he told so, an’ den I was tuk out o’ de cell.”</p>

<p>Here the poor creature started after the
jailor for the performance of some duty.</p>

<p>I was now desirous to know what Captain
Crawford’s candid opinion was concerning slavery,
but the loud tones in which we were
forced to talk prevented me, for fear of drawing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
down some cruel punishment upon us. I conversed
on the subject, however, with my comrade,
Lieutenant Collins, and we both resolved
never to cease its agitation so long as the Lord
gave us life, and so long as there remained a
single slave on the fair soil of Columbia. Our
minds were much strengthened in this resolve
by recalling to memory the teachings of Washington,
Adams, Monroe, and others. Abigail
Adams, the mother of John Quincy Adams,
said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I wish most sincerely that there was not a
slave in the Province.”</p>
</div>

<p>Benjamin Franklin, whose life was my school-book,
in an address to the Senate and House of
Representatives, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“From a persuasion that equal liberty was
originally the portion, and is still the birthright,
of all men, and influenced by the strong ties of
humanity, and the principle of their institution,
your memorialists conceive themselves bound to
use all justifiable endeavors to loosen the bands
of slavery; that you will be pleased to countenance
the restoration of liberty to these unhappy
men, who alone, in this land of Freedom, are
degraded into perpetual bondage, and who,
amidst the general joy of surrounding freemen
are groaning in servile subjection; that you will
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
devise means for removing this inconsistency
from the character of the American people; that
you will promote mercy and justice towards

the very verge of the power vested in you, for
discouraging every species of traffic in the persons
of our fellow-men.”&mdash;B. F., Pres’t (<i>F. Gazette,

</div>

<p>During the dreary night I often awoke, and I
remember once, when thus arousing, those beautiful
lines came into my mind:</p>

<p class="chapsum">The Rebel Reveille&mdash;A Horrid Dinner&mdash;A
Reinforcement of Little Rebels&mdash;The Darkie’s Explanation&mdash;An
Exciting Trial&mdash;Hope of Release&mdash;Retribution&mdash;My Old
Chains doing good Service.</p>

<p class="noindent">The dawn came at last, bringing with it the
reveille of the rebel drums, and the yelling of
rebel guards. Our rations, however, took a
longer time to reach us, for it was not until about
eleven o’clock that the negro brought us a mess
of the stereotyped greens and corn-bread. A
glance into the pan showed us that the maggots
had received heavy reinforcements; but so, also,
had our hunger gained strength, and we were
glad to receive even the repulsive maggots and
spoiled-bread, and thank God we fared so well.
I could not forbear questioning the negro concerning
this outrageous food, and from him I
received the following explanation:</p>

<p>The jailor had some time before purchased a
lot of meat at a lower figure than it could now
be bought for, for the reason that a portion
of it was tainted. The worst of this meat had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
been thrown aside into a large box used for
holding soap-grease.</p>

<p>“He tole me, sah,” said the negro, “to go to
dat box and get dat meat, an’ when I tole him
it stink like de debbil, he swore de tallest kind
o’ swore dat I lied, an’ fur me to go git it, as it
wus plenty good ’nuff for dem d&mdash;&mdash;d Yankees.
I’se sorry, sah, but I had to do as massa
tole me.”</p>

<p>We were satisfied with the poor slave’s explanation,
and shutting our eyes, demolished
our horrid dinner to the last atom, and were
still as hungry as ever, for the quantity of the
food was as meagre as its quality. As yet I
had received no reply to the letter I had sent
out by the hands of the negro, to whom I have
previously referred. Days and nights passed
successively in monotonous misery, and still I
beheld the face of no friend save that One
which beamed down from above, and supported
me in all my trials. Whenever we got the
opportunity, we used to question the negroes as
to their opinions and ideas concerning the war
and slavery. In so doing, we assumed a great
risk, as a white man who is caught conversing
with the slaves, receives the most rigorous treatment.
One day I asked the slave, who brought
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
us our scanty supply of loathsome food, what
he thought of the war.</p>

<p>“God bless you, sah,” he answered, in the
same whispering tones of caution as I myself
had used, “I knows all ’bout it, an’ all us niggas
knows all ’bout it. Why I couldn’t tell you
half what we knows an’ what we says ’mong
ourselves, sah!”</p>

<p>“God grant that more light may be sent into
the land of the slave, and salvation to the downtrodden
inhabitants thereof!” prayed I, as the
negro, seeing his master, hurried away from
our cell.</p>

<p>Our rest was much disturbed at night by the
howling and yelping of a dog, which was
doubtless as much ill treated and starved as we
were ourselves.</p>

<p>Time rolled on, but still no event occurred to
dispel the gloom that surrounded me, until I
learned that the man I had met on the cars,
and who, it will be remembered, asserted that
he had known me in Cincinnati, had arrived in
Macon. I learned, also, that he was reporting it
about the town, that, in Ohio I was possessed of
some degree of influence. The faithful slave
who told me this added:</p>

<p>“One of you is a-gwine to be taken out, for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
I heard de sheriff say that a lot o’ people went
to the Major, and wanted him to let you out.”</p>

<p>This was, of course, like a star of hope in a
dark horizon, and day after day I awaited the
appearance of some deliverer who should bid
me walk forth free. But, alas! it was a delusive
dream, for none came, and I was no nearer
liberty than ever.</p>

<p>About this time, an occurrence took place
which I here record, to show the workings of that
pernicious system which is the real root of all
our national troubles. I was standing at the
bars of my cell, looking out into the prison
yard, and saw Woods, the jailor, order the
negro, who used to wait on us, to bring him an
ax. Upon receiving it, he deliberately broke
off the lock of a trunk that belonged to Captain
Clay Crawford, and took therefrom a watch
and several cards of jewelry. Soon after the
darkey brought us our rations, and upon our
speaking of the affair, he was quite surprised
that we knew of it. He said the trunk was
Mr. Crawford’s, and smiled knowingly.</p>

<p>Two days after, a party of men came for the
trunk, and found it broken open, as I have
stated. They, of course, called the jailor to
account, and he was fairly implicated in the
matter. Without hesitation, however, the vile
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
robber accused the poor negro of having committed
the act. Of course the latter denied
the charge, and told the whole truth about it.
This enraged Woods, and he tied him up to a
rough timber cross so that, while his arms were
stretched to their utmost extent, his toes barely
touched the ground. He then took a heavy
whip, with three thongs, and lashed the unfortunate
negro until his shirt was actually soaked
in blood.</p>

<p>Occasionally the monster ceased a moment,
and bade the victim of his brutality to confess
to the deed; but with the most heroic fortitude
the poor slave refused to comply, and Woods,
finding that he could not succeed thus, untied
the bleeding man, and threw him into the cell
next to our own.</p>

<p>Between us there was only an iron grating,
so that we could converse with the negro, and
see with our own eyes the horrible treatment
to which he had been subjected.</p>

<p>As chance had it, Captain Clay Crawford
himself had been a witness of all the proceedings,
and upon seeing the negro so unmercifully
beaten, he lost his temper, and uttered a
rent of oaths, swearing that he saw the
jailor do the deed. As he was regarded, however,
as a Yankee, his word had no more effect
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
than the negro’s. As I gazed upon the quivering
back of that poor, downtrodden African, I
exclaimed, in the words of Thomas Pringle:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Oh, slavery, thou art a bitter draught,</div>
<div class="verse">And twice accursed is thy poisoned bowl,</div>
<div class="verse">Which taints with leprosy the white man’s soul!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>In the power of such monsters what might not we expect at their
blood-stained hands? There was but one Deliverer for us, as well as the
slave, and that deliverer was God, and on Him we cast ourselves, feeling
that He was all-powerful. Job truly wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“The wicked man travaileth with pain all
his days, and the number of years is hidden to
the oppressor.”</p>
</div>

<p>And with equal truth did the prophet exclaim:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“So I returned, and considered all the oppression
that is done under the sun, and beheld
the tears of such as were oppressed, and they
had no comfort. And on the side of the oppressed
there was power, but they had no comfort.”</p>
</div>

<p>Oh, may the hand be stilled in death that
would raise itself to defend such a system!</p>

<p>While the jailor was in the midst of his
trouble, the star of hope that had arisen on the
coming to Macon of my Ohio friend, and then
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
set so suddenly, came up once more, but with
more cheering brilliancy this time; for, through
the hubbub that he had raised, I was released
from my prison cell the very day on which the
poor negro, who had been so unmercifully
lashed, was to have his trial. I was scarcely
fit to be seen, for I was yet clothed in the
wretched rags in which I had lived for several
months. Yet, notwithstanding this, when I
appeared before the Major, whose opinion, since
having heard of my real character and position,
was wonderfully changed, he began to bow and
scrape in his best style.</p>

<p>“Oh, sir,” he exclaimed, “I did not know
that you were a minister, or I would not have
had you put into that cell. And now,” added
he, “I will give you a parole of the town, and
you may report here every morning.”</p>

<p>As commissioners had come to terms concerning
the exchange of prisoners, the only object
that the contemptible Major had in view,
was to induce me, upon my return home, to
speak well of him and his friends. I must confess
that I lost my temper. However, I said
nothing, but, called, in very positive tones, for a
guard to accompany me to the military prison,
which was near at hand. As I was going thither,
the thought that the poor negro was to be tried
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
that day for the offence which had been really
committed by his master, shot across my mind,
and I resolved that I would do my duty in the
matter. I instantly returned to the commandant,
and asked him to give me a parole of the
town. This he forthwith did, as he imagined
that I wished to purchase new clothing. He
furnished me, also, with two guards with loaded
muskets. I then went to the building where
the trial was being held. Upon entering the
room, I saw the poor, friendless slave, loaded
with chains, sitting in the culprit’s dock, while
the brutal Woods sat confidently near him,
fully expecting to have him condemned. When
I mildly requested the court to allow me to
speak a word in defence of the accused, Woods
sprang to his feet, and swore that they would
not listen to any d&mdash;&mdash;d Yankee. This brought
the owner of the negro to <i>his</i> feet, with the
exclamation, that I was a white man, and, consequently,
entitled to speak. A long debate
ensued on this point, which was settled finally
in my favor, and I took the stand.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” I began, “I am a Yankee prisoner.
I have been in some three or four of
your county jails, and several of your penitentiaries;
but still your commandant has confidence
in me, and has given a parole of the town, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
your surgeon has made statements which prove
me to be a man of some little credit at home.
If, therefore, I shall find any favor in your
eyes, I will make a statement in reference to
the matter on trial.”</p>

<p>I paused until I was assured by the court
that what I had to say would receive credence,
and then resumed:</p>

<p>“I saw that man, Woods, who sits here at
my right, force the prisoner at the bar to bring
him an axe. Upon receiving it, he deliberately
broke open the trunk referred to, and took
therefrom a watch and a card of jewelry. Subsequently,
that he might extort from the prisoner
a false acknowledgment of guilt, he tied
him up, and beat him most inhumanly.”</p>

<p>This brought Woods to his feet once more,
livid with rage.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say that I broke open
that trunk, do you, sir?” he ejaculated, shaking
at me his clenched fists.</p>

<p>“I do; and you know you did it!” was my
prompt reply.</p>

<p>The villain thereupon lost all control of himself,
and, drawing a bowie-knife, swore vengeance
upon me. I quietly stepped back, and
placed myself between the two guards, who,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
lowering their pieces, prepared to protect me,
should my assailant attempt to do me violence.</p>

<p>I then made a statement that my testimony
could be corroborated, if necessary, by Captain
Clay Crawford himself, and Lieutenant Collins,
both officers in the United States army. He
quibbled, and protested, and reasoned, and
raved alternately; but it was all useless, and
when at last I told the minutest particulars
about the affair, such as where the negro took
the axe from, <i>et cetera</i>, he was forced to give in,
and was accordingly found guilty, while the
poor black fellow was released amid the most
tumultuous excitement.</p>

<p>To show that Providence was retributive in
this case, I need only state that the crest-fallen
culprit was taken from court, placed in the
same cell in which I had been incarcerated, was
chained with the same irons, slept on the same
filthy bed, and I have no doubt was bitten and
tormented by the identical little inhabitants of
the last, by which I had been long annoyed, so
much to his merriment.</p>

<p>Before my time was out, I reported at the
jail, and then went over to the military prison,
where I had a bone removed from my wounded
hand. I then passed in among the prisoners,
and while conversing with them, I was obliged
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
to repeat the story of my escape and recapture
many times. That night, on account of the
pain I suffered, I was unable to sleep, and so I
spent the still hours in reflections on my situation,
God’s mercy and goodness, and on those
dear ones at home, who were then, most likely,
peacefully slumbering and dreaming of a soldier
of the Union, far away in a Southern prison,
wounded and weary, and no one even to speak
a word of kindness to him.</p>

<p>The next day I heard of many deaths which
had occurred during my absence. Quite a
number of the names were familiar to me, and
my heart was indeed sad. Some of these noble
fellows died shouting for God and their country
with their last breath. Think of it, reader,
and let it awaken your grateful remembrances
for the heroic martyrs. They had left pleasant
homes, fruitful fields, beloved relations, and
cherished friends, to fight and suffer for the
Union. And there, in a loathsome prison, without
a pillow for their dying heads, without a
covering, without proper food, without medicine,
without water even to slake their burning
tongues, they died, a glorious sacrifice on a
glorious altar.</p>

<p class="noindent">A large proportion of the prisoners in Macon
were nearly naked, and actually were obliged
to wrap rags of blankets about themselves to
hide their nakedness, and many times, while
listening to their stories of wrong and woe, I
was moved to tears. Among several harrowing
incidents, about this time occurred the shooting
of one of our party, a political prisoner, if I
remember right, who was deaf. A brutal
guard had fired on him because he did not
obey some order which he had given, but which
of course, the victim did not hear. I saw the
poor fellow writhing in his death-agonies. The
shot had pierced directly through his bowels,
inflicting a horrid and mortal wound.</p>

<div class="caption">
“The prisoner is thrown to the ground, either face or
back down, according to the whim of the punisher, and a number of
stakes are driven in the earth around him.”&mdash;Page 211.
</div>
</div>

<p>Another man named Flood, for the offence
of coming nearer than ten feet to the guard-lines,
was pinned down to the earth. As this
punishment is doubtless not understood by a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
majority of readers, I will describe it. The
person subjected to it is thrown to the ground,
either face or back down, according to the whim
of the punisher, and while held in this position,
a number of stakes or wooden pins are driven
in the earth around him, in such a manner as
to bind him immovably to the ground. A
more terrible punishment can scarcely be conceived.</p>

<p>Flood was a large man, and possessed of immense
strength; and the first time he was thus
pinned down, he tore himself loose from his fastenings.
Upon seeing this, his captors again
seized him. But he struggled manfully, and it
was not until six or eight powerful men attacked
him simultaneously, and with weapons, that he
was secured. This done, however, they obtained
stakes that an ox could not have broken, and
with these they fastened their victim down
firmly that it was impossible for him to move
half an inch. And in this position, he lay face
down for <i>twenty-four hours</i>, during which time a
heavy rain fell. In consequence he took a
fatal cold, and, four days later, he was laid in
the grave. This punishment was quite common
among the rebels.</p>

<p>While listening to the accounts of my fellow-prisoners,
especially concerning the deaf man
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
and Flood, I could not help thinking bitterly of
the thousands in the free North, who, while our
country is struggling for existence, are apologizing
for the vile system which breeds such
monsters as I have been describing. Oh
reader, if you would be just to yourself and to
God, and not allow your mind to be influenced
by the fallacies with which traitors would delude
you, you would at once perceive the fountain-spring
of all our national troubles to be
naught else but slavery. And here, at the
expense of interrupting my personal narrative,
I have concluded to advance some facts and
arguments in support of my conclusions. It is
a most common and dangerous fallacy to condemn
the emancipation theory of Abraham
Lincoln, as the cause of this terrible bloodshed
that has been going on for two years past.
Now I assume the opposite side of the argument,
and find myself supported therein, not
only by common sense, but all the teachings of
past history.</p>

<p>When the question of immediate abolition
was first agitated in England, the friends of
slavery were loud in their belief that universal
insurrection and bloodshed would follow; and
nothing could have taken a stronger hold on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
the sympathies and fears of the people than
these same assertions.</p>

<p>In June, 1793, a civil war occurred between
the aristocrats and republicans of St. Domingo,
and the planters called in the aid of Great
Britain. The opposing party proclaimed freedom
to all slaves, and armed them against the
British. It is generally supposed that the abolition
of slavery in St. Domingo was in consequence
of insurrection among the slaves.
Nothing is farther from the truth, for the
whole measure was nothing more nor less than
one of political expediency. A little research
into the histories of the island about this period
will show that the whole colored population
remained faithful to the republicans to whom
they owed their liberty.</p>

<p>The British were defeated, and were obliged
to evacuate the island; but they still held possession
of the ocean, and consequently troubled
the French to such an extent, that the latter
were entirely unable to look after St. Domingo.
The colonists were therefore left to themselves.
Certainly here was an opportunity for the
breaking forth of that dreaded insurrection
which had been predicted as the sure result of
immediate abolition. Yet, on the contrary,
though there were <i>five hundred thousand negroes</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
thus unfettered and made free, there was an
actual decrease in crime, and a corresponding
increase in the prosperity and peace of the
island.</p>

<p>A resident, Colonel Malenfaut, says in his
historical memoir:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“After this public act of emancipation, the
negroes remained quiet both in the south and
west, and they continued to work upon all the
plantations. Even upon those estates which
had been abandoned by owners and managers,
the negroes continued their labor where there
were any agents to guide; and where no white
men were left to direct them, they betook themselves
to planting provisions. The colony was
flourishing. The whites lived happily and in
peace upon their estates, and the negroes continued
to work for them.”</p>
</div>

<p>General La Croix, in his memoir, speaking of
the same period, writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“The colony marched as by enchantment
towards its ancient splendor; cultivation prospered,
and every day produced perceptible
proofs of its progress. This prosperous state of
things lasted about eight years, and would probably
have continued to this day, had not Bonaparte,
at the instigation of the old aristocratic
French planters, sent an army to deprive the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
blacks of the freedom which they had used so
well. It was the attempt to restore slavery that
produced all the bloody horrors of St. Domingo.
Emancipation produced the most blessed effects.”</p>
</div>

<p>In June, 1794, Victor Hugo, a French republican
general, retook the island of Guadaloupe
from the British, and immediately proclaimed
freedom to all the slaves. They were <i>thirty-five
thousand</i> in number, and the whites <i>thirteen
thousand</i>. No disaster whatever occurred from
the humane action of Hugo.</p>

<p>On the 10th of October, 1811, the Chilian
Congress decreed that every child born after
that date, should be free. Likewise, the congress
of Columbia emancipated all slaves who
had borne arms in defence of the Republic, and
provided for the emancipation, in eighteen years,
of the whole slave population, amounting to
nine hundred thousand beings.</p>

<p>September, 1829, saw immediate liberty
granted by the government of Mexico to every
slave in the realm.</p>

<p>Now, in all these cases not one single insurrection
or bloodshed has ever been heard of
as resulting from emancipation.</p>

<p>Even the thirty thousand Hottentots&mdash;the
most ignorant, degraded people on the earth&mdash;who
were manumitted at Cape colony, in July,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
1823, gave instant evidence of improvement on
being admitted to the rights and privileges of
freemen. As a gentleman facetiously remarked,
they worked far better for Mr. Cash than they
had for Mr. Lash.</p>

<p>A statement in the <i>South African Commercial
Advertiser</i>, of February, 1813, read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Three thousand prize negroes have received
their freedom&mdash;four hundred in one day. But
not the least difficulty or disaster occurred.
Servants found masters, and masters hired servants;
all gained homes, and, at night, scarcely
an idler was to be seen. To state that sudden
emancipation would create disorder and distress
to those you mean to serve, is not reason, but
the plea of all men adverse to abolition.”</p>
</div>

<p>On the 1st of August, 1834, the government
of Great Britain emancipated the slaves in all
her colonies, of which she had twenty, viz.,
seventeen in the West Indies, and three in the
East Indies. The numerical superiority of the
negroes in the West was great. In Jamaica,
there were three hundred and thirty-one thousand
slaves, and only thirty-seven thousand
whites.</p>

<p>Even by the clumsy apprenticeship system,
where the stimulus of the whip was removed
without being replaced by the stimulus of wages,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
the negroes were a little improved. They knew
they would not be lashed if they did not work,
and that if they did work they would not be
paid for it. Yet, under such disadvantages as
these, there occurred no difficulty, excepting in
three of the islands, and even there they were
slight and only temporary. Even the bitterest
enemies of abolition have not yet been able to
show that a single drop of blood has been shed,
or a single plantation destroyed, in consequence
of emancipation in all the British West Indies!</p>

<p>The journals of Antigua, where the apprenticeship
system was not tried, but the stimulus
of wages applied at once, say:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“The great doubt is solved, and the highest
hopes of the negro’s friends are fulfilled. Thirty
thousand men have passed from slavery into
freedom, not only without the slightest irregularity,
but with the solemn and decorous tranquillity
of a Sabbath. In Antigua, there an
two thousand whites, thirty thousand slaves,
and four thousand five hundred free blacks.”</p>
</div>

<p>Antigua and St. Christopher’s are within
gunshot of each other, and both are sugar-growing
colonies. In the latter island, the proportion
of blacks is smaller than in the former,
yet St. Christopher’s has had some difficulty
with the gradual system, while the quiet of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
Antigua has not been disturbed for one hour
by immediate manumission. Such facts are
worth more than volumes of sophistry.</p>

<p>If, however, the humane view be not allowed,
let us look at the question in a pecuniary one.
The results in this direction, of the British
Emancipation Bill, are truly wonderful. To
the astonishment of even the most sanguine
friends of abolition, the plantations of the colonies
are more productive, more easily managed,
and accepted as security for higher sums or
mortgages, than they ever were under the slave
system. It appears from an official statement,
that in the first quarter of the present year,
there is an increase over the average of the first
quarter of the three years preceding emancipation
in the great staples of West Indian produce
exported, as follows:</p>

<p>From Georgetown, Demarara, twenty per
cent. increase. From Berbice, fifty per cent.
increase. Coffee increased about one hundred
per cent.</p>

<p>The hundred million indemnity thus appears
to have been a compensation for having been
made richer.</p>

<p>Now, with all this weight of testimony, it is
impossible for the candid reader to cleave any
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
longer to the idea that emancipation is the cause
of all this misery.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“If,” says a distinguished logician, “you
have a right to make another man a slave, he
has a right to make you a slave.”
“And if we have no right,” 
says Ramsey,
“to sell him, no
one has a right to purchase him. If ever
negroes, bursting their chains, should come
(which Heaven forbid!) on the European coast,
to drag whites of both sexes from their families,
to chain them, and conduct them to Africa, and
mark them with a hot iron; if whites stolen,
sold, purchased by criminals, and placed under
the guidance of merciless inspectors, were immediately
compelled, by the stroke of the whip,
to work in a climate injurious to their health,
when at the close of each day they could have
no other consolation than that of advancing another
step to the tomb, no other perspective
than to suffer and to die in all the anguish of
despair; if devoted to misery and ignominy,
they were excluded from all the privileges of
society, and declared legally incapable of judicial
action, their testimony not admitted against the
black class; if, driven from the sidewalks, they
were compelled to mingle with the animals in
the middle of the street; if a conscription were
made to have them lashed in a mass, and their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
backs, to prevent gangrene, covered with pepper
and salt; if the forfeit for killing them were
but a trifling sum; if a reward were offered for
apprehending those who escaped from slavery;
if those who escaped were hunted by a pack of
hounds, trained to carnage; if, blaspheming
the Divinity, the blacks pretended that by
their origin they had permission of heaven to
preach passive obedience and resignation to the
whites; if greedy, hireling writers published
that, for this reason, just reprisals might be
exercised against rebellious whites, and that
white slaves were happy, more happy than the
peasants in the bosom of Africa; in a word, if
all the arts of cunning calumny, all the strength
and fury of avarice, all the invention of ferocity,
were directed against you by a coalition of
merchants, priests, kings, soldiers and colonists,
what a cry of horror would resound through
these countries! To express it, new epithets
would be sought. A crowd of writers, and
particularly poets, would exhaust their eloquent
lamentations, provided, that having nothing to
fear, there was something to gain.</p>

<p>“Europeans, reverse this hypothesis, and see
what you are. Yes, I repeat it, there is not a
vice, not a species of wickedness, of which
Europe is not guilty towards negroes, of which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
she has not shown them the example. Avenging
God! suspend thy thunder, exhaust thy
compassion in giving her time and courage to
repair, if possible, these horrors and atrocities!”</p>
</div>

<p>Now, these things are all perfectly reasonable.
Though written a long time ago, they are now
not the less true; and those of us who may live
to see the end of this war will know well the
cause of it; and I trust that the rising generation
may profit by the history of their fathers.
May they learn from their earliest years to
denounce the name that offers an apology for
the dark curse of slavery!</p>

<p>It was of this evil that Jefferson spoke in
the original Declaration of Independence,
drafted by himself, but suppressed by Southern
influence. The language is:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“He has waged cruel war against human
nature itself, violating its most sacred rights of
life and liberty, in the persons of a distant people,
who never offended him; capturing them
and carrying them into slavery in another
hemisphere, or to incur miserable death in
their transportation thither. This piratical
warfare, the opprobrium of infidel powers, is
the warfare of the Christian King of Great
Britain. Determined to keep open a market
where men should be bought and sold, he has
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
prostituted his prerogative for suppressing every
legislative attempt to prohibit or restrain this
execrable commerce. And that this assemblage
of horrors might want no fact of distinguished
dye, he is now exciting those very people to
rise in arms among us, and to purchase that
liberty of which he has deprived them, thus
paying off former crimes committed against the
liberties of one people, with crimes which he
urges them to commit against the lives of
another.”</p>
</div>

<p>The same spirit possessed the heart of Luther
Martin, when, before the Legislature of Maryland,
he delivered a report concerning the topic
of which we speak. The report was adopted
by a majority of the convention, though not
without considerable opposition.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“It was said that we had just assumed a place
among independent nations, in consequence of
our opposition to the attempts of Great Britain
to enslave us. That this opposition was grounded
upon the preservation of those rights to
which God and nature entitled us, not in particular,
but in common with all the rest of
mankind. That we had appealed to the Supreme
Being for His assistance, as the God of
freedom, who could not but approve our efforts
to preserve the rights which he had thus
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
imparted to all his creatures. That now, when we
scarcely had risen from our knees and supplications
for his aid and protection, in the form
of government we had chosen, we proposed to
have a provision therein, not only putting it
out of its power to restrain and prevent the
slave trade, but actually to encourage that most
infamous traffic, by giving the States power
and influence in the Union, in proportion as
they cruelly and wantonly sported with the
rights of their fellow creatures. Such a course
ought to be considered a solemn mockery of,
and insult to, that God whose protection we
had implored, and it could not fail to hold us
up to the detestation and contempt of every
true friend of liberty in the world. National
crimes can only be, and frequently are punished,
at least, in the world, by national calamities.
And if we thus give national sanction to the
slave trade, we justly expose ourselves to the displeasure
and vengeance of Him who is equally
Lord of all, and who views with equal eye the
poor African slave and his American master.”</p>
</div>

<p>The same fire which dictated the above,
burned also in Captain Riley’s heart, when he
exclaimed:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Strange as it may seem to the philanthropist,
my free and proud-spirited countrymen
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
still hold a million and a half of human beings
in the most cruel bonds of slavery, who are
kept at hard labor, and, smarting under the lash
of inhuman, mercenary drivers, in many instances
enduring the miseries of hunger, thirst,
imprisonment, cold, nakedness, and even tortures.
This is no picture of the imagination.
For the honor of human nature, I wish likenesses
were nowhere to be found. I myself
have witnessed such scenes in different parts of
my own country, and the bare recollection of
them now chills my blood with horror.”</p>
</div>

<p>In connection with this, we have the statement
of De Witt Clinton, who, during the
period of his legislative career&mdash;1797&mdash;bestowed
a large portion of his attention to the protection
of the public health, the promotion of agriculture,
manufactures, and the arts, the <i>gradual</i>
abolition of slavery, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The record of the proceedings of the Senate
of New York for the sessions of 1809-11
exhibits proofs of Mr. Clinton’s great usefulness.
Under his auspices, the New York
Historical Society was incorporated, the Orphan
Asylum and free schools were fostered and
encouraged. He introduced laws to prevent
kidnapping, and the further introduction of
slaves; also to punish those who should treat
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
slaves inhumanly.&mdash;<i>De Witt Clinton’s Life in
Delaplaine’s Repository.</i></p>

<p>I have been forced, after honest and serious
consideration, to the conclusion, that God, who
rules all the affairs of men, is now speaking to
the American nation in thunder tones. He is
afflicting us for the terrible sin of slavery.</p>

<p>The great fear of those who have fostered
this rebellion, is that a true knowledge of God
and his word would be instilled into the minds
of the people. This is proven by their own
arguments. Let us cite one from General Duff
Green’s favorite strain:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“We are of those who believe that the South
has nothing to fear from a servile war. We do
not believe that the abolitionists intend, nor
could they if they would, to excite the slaves
to insurrection. The danger of this is remote.
We believe we have most to fear from the
organized action upon the consciences and fears
of the slaveholders themselves; from the insinuations
of their dangerous heresies into our
schools and pulpits and our domestic circles.
It is only by alarming the consciences of the
weak and feeble, and diffusing among our own
people a morbid sensibility on the question of
slavery, that the abolitionists can accomplish
their object. Preparatory to this, they are now
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
laboring to saturate the non-slaveholding States
with the belief that slavery is a sin against God;
that the national compact involves the non-slaveholders
in that sin, and that it is their duty to
toil and suffer that our country may be delivered
from what they term its blackest stain, its foulest
reproach, its deadliest curse.”&mdash;<i>Southern Review.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Such arguments as these blacken the souls
of thousands, shut up the avenues of knowledge
in the South, and push on the car of slavery
until it crushes all liberty beneath its iron
wheels.</p>

<p>While I was thus in my old prison a second
time, I met with a friend, Rev. William Rogers.
During my absence he had organized a Sabbath-school
among the prisoners. He had been fortunate
enough to obtain, by some means or
other, a copy of the Old or New Testament,
and from this precious volume he used to read
to the captives, who listened to him in alternate
groups. Just about the time that Mr. Rogers
was producing a good effect by this habit, the
school was peremptorily discontinued by the
rebels, who feared the dissemination of abolition
doctrines, notwithstanding the fact that Rogers
was a Southern man.</p>

<p>While here, I made the acquaintance of Dr.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
Doke of East Tennessee, and Dr. Fish of Illinois,
both of whom were busy day and night
ministering to the physical wants and ailments
of the prisoners. Medical stores were meagre,
and Dr. Doke informed me that to this cause was
traceable one-half the deaths that occurred.</p>

<p>Mr. Rogers and I, falling into conversation
one afternoon, struck upon the question of
God’s special providence. In this we agreed
very well, but on that of slavery we were opposed
to each other. He had been all his life
an inhabitant of the South, and though he did
not fully justify the keeping of slaves, he did
not so blindly and bitterly denounce those of
an opposite opinion, as Southerners are generally
wont to do. But I still pray for God to
bless this good divine, as he loves and venerates
the Stars and Stripes. He is one of that class
who, notwithstanding all the ordinances of secession
cannot give up their affection for the
old standard.</p>

<p>Soon after this, we were sent to Atlanta,
Georgia, under guard of one lieutenant. This
was the first privilege we had yet enjoyed, and
we appreciated it accordingly. Along the route
the rebels were extremely anxious to converse
with us, but we remained decidedly silent, for
the least word, inconsiderately spoken, would
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
have placed us at the mercy of a mob, and we
well knew what result would follow that. We
were often insulted by such expressions as
“Yankee thieves,” “nigger-stealers,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>With no other incidents than these, we reached
Atlanta in safety. Here we found a large
number of Confederate wounded from Virginia,
for whom large tables had been set out, spread
with what food and luxuries could be obtained.</p>

<p>As I was still dressed in the ragged Confederate
uniform in which I had escaped from
prison, a lady hailed me, to know if I was a
soldier. Of course, I answered yes, and for a
moment hesitated about the rest of my answer;
but, thinking any other course might be productive
of ill, I added that I was a United
States soldier, and of course could not expect
to share in a meal set out specially for Confederates.
With an assumption of affectation,
she turned away, saying:</p>

<p>“Ah, we do not feed Yankees!”</p>

<p>But I noticed her dark eyes closely following
me as I limped away through the crowd, and
ere I was out of sight, she came hurrying
through the latter, as though to speak to some
one near me, and she whispered in my ear:</p>

<p>“I am from New York, and I will give you
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
a cup of coffee. Come around, and I will slip
it to you, but you must keep silent.”</p>

<p>My heart swelled with emotion as I obeyed
this angel woman, and I know the tears dropped
on my face, as, with husky tones, I thanked her
for the mug of rye coffee and the nice biscuit
she placed in my hands.</p>

<p>We remained here long enough to learn that
a captain and three Tennesseeans had been hung
for their Union sentiments, and to learn also
that captives fared very badly. Then we pushed
on to Madison, where we were incarcerated in
an old factory building, four stories high, and
situated in the southeastern portion of the town.
It was two o’clock, A. M., when we arrived, and
we were immediately locked up in a room entirely
destitute of a bed. But still there was
such a contrast between it and the old jail in
which we had been immured, that we thought
it very fine indeed.</p>

<p>We lay down till morning, and when we
arose, we found ourselves in company with
General Prentiss and General Crittenden, together
with two hundred and sixteen other
officers of various grades. Here also I met with
my old prison companions, Lieutenants Todd,
Stokes, Hollingsworth, and Winslow&mdash;all clergymen
like myself&mdash;Lieutenant-Colonel Adams,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
Majors Crockett, Chandler, McCormick and
Studman. I soon formed an agreeable acquaintance
with General Prentiss, who was taken
prisoner on Sunday, April 6th, 1862, at Shiloh.
It had generally been reported that the General
had surrendered early in the morning;
but this was false, for I now learned that he did
not give up until five o’clock in the afternoon,
thus holding at least five or six times his own
number in check the whole of that dreadful
day. Without doubt, history will do the gallant
hero justice; for on that bloody field he
displayed coolness and heroism seldom equalled
and never excelled.</p>

<p>I found General Prentiss not one of your
half-hearted war men, who fight conditionally,
but a whole-souled patriot, who would destroy
the institution that is the root of the war. He
would not see the glorious banner trailed in the
dust to uphold a few Southern aristocrats in
perpetuating their horrid system of human
bondage. His feelings were consonant with
those of John Quincy Adams, when that wise
man addressed Congress, February 4th, 1843,
in the following words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Three days since, Mr. Clayton, of Georgia,
called that species of population (slaves) the
machinery of the South. Now, that machinery
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
has twenty odd representatives in this hall, not
elected by the machinery, but by those who
own it. And if I should go back to the history
of the Government from its foundations, it
would be easy to prove that its decisions have
been effected in general by less majorities than
that. Nay, I might go further, and insist that
that very representation has ever been, in fact,
the ruling power of this Government.</p>

<p>“The history of the Union has afforded a
continual proof that the representation of property,
which they enjoy, as well in the election
of President and Vice-President of the United
States, as upon the floor of the House of Representatives,
has secured to the slaveholding
States the entire control of the national policy,
and almost without exception, the possession of
the highest executive office of the Union. Always
united in the purpose of regulating the
affairs of the whole Union by the standard of
the slaveholding interest, their disproportionate
numbers in the electoral colleges have enabled
them, in ten out of twelve quadrennial elections,
to confer the Chief Magistracy upon one of their
own citizens. Their suffrages at every election,
without exception, have been exclusively confined
to a candidate of their own caste.”</p>
</div>

<p>General Prentiss was kind and affable to all
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
around him, and among fifteen hundred men of
his command with whom I freely conversed,
there was not one who did not love and respect
him.</p>

<p>Every day found me growing more and more
hostile to the slave system; and the actions of
the various States against slavery often recurred
to my mind, and always produced a pleasurable
feeling. Pennsylvania took the lead in this
noble race. The Act is to be found in Smith’s
Laws, Vol. I., p. 493, 1780. It was for the
gradual abolishment of slavery, and every word
of it should have been printed in letters of gold.
This just Act was, for a long course of years,
adhered to and perfected until slavery ceased in
the State.</p>

<p>In the year 1827, the following open avowal
of the State doctrine was made preface to the
Act:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<i>To prevent certain abuses of the laws relative
to fugitives from labor.</i></p>

<p>“They ought not to be tolerated in the State
of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>“Above all let us never yield up the right
of the free discussion of any evil which may
arise in the land or any part of it; convinced
that the moment we do so, the bond of the
Union is broken. For the Union, a voluntary
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
compact to continue together for certain specified
purposes, the instant one portion of it succeeds
in imposing terms and dictating conditions
upon another not found in the contract, the relation
between them changes, and that which
was union becomes subjection.”&mdash;<i>Message to
Pennsylvania Legislature</i>, 1836.</p>
</div>

<p>Had we obeyed these admonitions when it
was first attempted to stop our arguments, had
we stood up like men and never yielded our
rights on this subject, our foes would never
have succeeded. Oh, that the united North
had stood up like the martyr, Elijah Lovejoy!
Said he:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I know that I have a right fully to speak and
publish my sentiments, subject only to the laws
of the land for the abuse of that right; and this
right was given to me by my Maker, and is
solemnly guaranteed to me by the Constitution
of the United States and also the State. What
I wish to know of you is, whether you will
protect me in this right, or whether, as heretofore,
I am to be subjected to personal indignity
and outrage.”</p>
</div>

<p>Was this noble man protected? No! He
fell into the arms of his brother one day, shot,
down on the threshold of his own house, by the
bullet of a cowardly and fanatical assassin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>General Crittenden, with whom I also became
acquainted here, was a slaveholder, yet he did
not pretend to endorse the system. Another
gentleman, Lieutenant-Colonel Pratt, of Missouri,
born and bred in North Carolina, was
strongly anti-slavery in his views.</p>

<p>Henry Clay, that peerless statesman, made the
following remarks in a speech before a meeting
of the Colonization Society:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“As a mere laborer, the slave feels that he
toils for his master, and not for himself; that
the laws do not recognize his capacity to acquire
and hold property, which depends altogether
upon the pleasure of his proprietor; and
that all the fruits of his exertion are reaped by
others. He knows that whether sick or well,
in times of scarcity or abundance, his master is
bound to provide for him by the all-powerful
influence of self-interest. He is generally, therefore,
indifferent to the adverse or prosperous
fortunes of his master, being contented if he
can escape his displeasure or chastisement by a
careless and slovenly performance of his duties.</p>

<p>“That labor is best in which the laborer
knows that he will receive the profits of his industry,
and where his employment depends
upon his diligence, and his reward upon his
assiduity. He then has every motive to excite
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
him to exertion, and animate him to perseverance.
He knows that if he is treated badly,
he can exchange his employer. With the proceeds
of his toil to his own hands, he distributes
it as his pleasure indicates. In a word, he is a
free agent, with rights, privileges, and sensibilities.
Wherever the option exists to employ, at
an equal hire, free or slave labor, the former
will always have the preference. It is more
capable, more diligent, more faithful, and in
every respect more worthy of confidence.”</p>
</div>

<p>Among the prisoners with whom I was in
company, there were ninety-six incarcerated for
political offences; that means for conscience’
sake. They were mostly from East Tennessee,
and they all, with one exception, believed
slavery to be the cause of the war. This they
often remarked to me, and invariably added
that the war would never cease until slavery
was destroyed. These opinions were expressed
before we heard of the President’s proclamation.</p>

<p>“Why, sir,” remarked I, to a Tennesseean of
wealth and influence, “we are told by men in
our country, that if you in the South thought
this, you would be a united opposition at once.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” was the answer, “there are some in
the South, now Union men whom this notion
might affect; but the truth is, that you can
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
never restore the Union until you emancipate
the slaves. For their masters can use them,
both small and great, old and young, as efficiently
as you can white men. They make them
hoe corn and cotton to feed and clothe soldiers
in the field; and here again the females are as
useful as the males. If I could see some move
made at this system of slavery, I would have
some hope. I am myself the owner of ten or
twelve slaves, and I would willingly give them
all up to see the desired result brought about.
Emancipation, sir, is the only hope that the
Union men have of a restoration. While you
return the slaves to their masters as soon as you
take them, there is no hope. You might as
well, when you take a rebel soldier prisoner,
send him immediately back to his own lines
without parole.”</p>

<p>My spirits were often depressed, and on one
of these occasions I committed all my papers
to the care of Captain Stedman, with whom I
had formed a friendship in prison, requesting
him that, in case I succumbed to my sufferings,
he would endeavor to forward them to my wife.</p>

<p>During the daytime, we were permitted the
liberty of the prison yard. One day, while
walking about, I noticed a cellar, to which
entrance was had from the yard. Into this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
dark cellar I made my way, and prayed to God
to remember me in my sore tribulation. Once,
when I was making my exit from this retreat
in company with a comrade or two who had
joined me, I was seen by Captain Stedman, who
on learning what we did there, begged us to
pray for him. The next night we prayed in
our apartment before retiring. This awakened
some surprise among the rest of our comrades,
some of whom were swearing and others playing
cards. The night following, we held a
regular prayer-meeting in our cellar, and God
blessed us, and made us exceedingly happy.
Each evening thereafter found us holding our
prayer-meetings, and each evening saw several
recruits added to our number. It had been
agreed that there was to be no noise, fearing,
as we did, that in case there was, we would be
discovered by the guards, and a stop put to our
proceedings. The rule was faithfully observed
until one night, Captain Stedman, receiving a
baptism from on high, could not restrain his
happiness, but shouted, “Glory to God in the
highest,” and the shout was taken up by the
rest.</p>

<p>Here, we thought, was an end of our meetings,
for the guards heard us. But we were agreeably
mistaken.</p>

Proclamation&mdash;A Negro Prayer&mdash;A “Big Bug”&mdash;A Casibianca&mdash;Death
of Mr. Eckels&mdash;Thoughts and Plans of
Escape&mdash;Lieutenant Pittenger.</p>

<p class="noindent">The next day after this occurrence, as I was
walking in the yard, a negro, who worked in
the prison, slyly pulled me as I was passing him,
and exclaimed in an under-tone:</p>

<p>“All us darkies gwine to be free, yah! yah!”</p>

<p>“What?” asked I, taking care to avoid being
seen by the guards.</p>

<p>“Why, all us nigs gwine to be free, yah!
yah! gin us yer coat, massa!”</p>

<p>I fully understood this coat business, as the
reader must be aware from an explanation previously
given, but, as I had no coat myself, I
went to Captain McCormick, my messmate, and
got his. It very fortunately had a long rip in
the right sleeve.</p>

<p>“Here, nigger,” cried I, in loud tones, “can’t
you get this coat mended?”</p>

<p>“Mended!” exclaimed the intelligent fellow,
in assumed tones of wrath, intended for the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
guards. “I wish dar wus no Yankees! dere
more bodder den dar wuff! good deal!”</p>

<p>“Go get it mended for him, you black
skunk!” exclaimed one of the guard, “and
make him pay well for’t.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s jes what dis yere nigger’ll do, I
golly!”</p>

<p>The coat was taken roughly away by the
negro, and returned the next morning, with the
rip mended, and a copy of the <i>Richmond Enquirer,
containing the President’s Emancipation
Proclamation, artfully concealed in the lining</i>!
The paragraph was carefully marked all around,
and its perusal gave me the utmost delight. I
dared not tell even my most intimate friends
how I got this paper, for there were spies
among us to report us.</p>

<p>I felt restive under the curb that kept my
tongue still, but the thought rose to comfort me,
that, though they bound me in the chains of
a slave, the day would come when, with the poet,
I could sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">“Oh, Liberty, thou Goddess heavenly bright,</div>

<div class="verse">Hear him, ye Senates, hear this truth sublime,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">He who allows oppression shares the crime.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>That night our prayer-meeting&mdash;which was
no longer secret&mdash;was one of the happiest we
ever enjoyed. I found that, like myself, all
had heard of the proclamation, and we all reverently
thanked God for it. Next to me was an
old negro who had been taken prisoner in East
Tennessee. He had originally been freed by
his master, a wealthy Georgian planter. When
this son of Africa prayed, he let himself out in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
all the power and exuberance of his strong but
uneducated mind.</p>

<p>“O, good Lord!” cried he, “don’t let off de
steam, but put on more steam, O, good Lord!
and don’t put on de brakes; but run her right
up to de fust of January! And den O, good,
blessed Lord, my wife’ll be free! Tank God!
glory! Amen! God send down de power!
Amen, and amen!”</p>

<p>As this earnest freedman ceased prayer, I
thought of my own white countrymen who
were fighting to keep the slave enchained:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">    
<div class="verse">“And we are free&mdash;but is there not</div>
<div class="verse indent1">One blot upon our name?</div>
<div class="verse">Is our proud record written fair</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Upon the scroll of fame?</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Our banner floateth by the shore,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Our flag upon the sea;</div>
<div class="verse">But when the fettered slave is loosed,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">We shall be truly free.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>That night I shall never forget, for we took
our prayer-meeting up to the second floor. We
had gained in strength, and God had shed his
blessing on our efforts, so that even the most
profane man in our midst, Captain Crawford,
was affected. Said he to me one day:</p>

<p>“After such demonstrations as I have witnessed
in your prayer-meetings, all the devils
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
in hell could not make me believe there was no
reality in religion.”</p>

<p>As the rebel authorities were now arresting
and imprisoning every man who refused to
bear arms for the Confederacy, we had additions
made to our numbers every morning. On one
occasion, among a crowd that were brought in,
was a very large man. He was five feet eight
inches high, and weighed <i>three hundred and
eighty pounds</i>. He was a man of wealth and
influence, and after having had innumerable
servants to wait upon him, it came rather hard
on him to be obliged to get his own place ready
to sleep in. I say <i>place</i>, for our quarters were
entirely innocent of a bed, and if we took
turns sleeping on a blanket, we considered ourselves
lucky. In the morning he spent some
time in rising, for it needed his utmost efforts
to get his vast body to an upright position.
His exertions ruffled his temper exceedingly,
and as the perspiration poured down his face,
he muttered to himself over and over again:</p>

<p>“Now, old Henry, you’ve got yourself in a
h&mdash;l of a fix, ain’t you, you d&mdash;&mdash;d old fool!”
Notwithstanding, this old man was very
gentlemanly in his deportment.</p>

<p>Among a batch that had lately arrived, was a
man whom the rebels were endeavoring to force
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
to take the oath of allegiance to the Southern
Confederacy. But his wife, who had been confined
just after his arrest, fearing that his regard
for her condition might induce him to
submit to what was demanded, sent her son,
who was only eight years old, to tell his father
not to take the oath.</p>

<p>This brave little fellow came nearly one
hundred miles on his mission, and, when he arrived,
the guards refused to admit him. Undaunted,
however, by the rebuff, the young hero
got close to the picket-fence, and shouted with
all his might:</p>

<p>“Pa! pa! don’t you swear! Oh, pa, don’t
you swear! We can get along; I got the lot
ploughed to put in the wheat!”</p>

<p>I wished at the time that this scene could be
witnessed by the whole North. I feel convinced
that in that case no one would raise a cry of
indignation at the arrest of traitors who cry for
peace, and who thus aid the South in oppressing
the really true Union men in that region.</p>

<p>A gentleman by the name of Shaw, was the
object of Confederate malice, and on no rational
grounds whatever. Hoping to secure a place of
refuge for his wife and helpless children, he
had, some ten months previous, sought to leave
his native State, Virginia, as he knew that the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
most terrible battles of the war must take place
there. On the road he was met and seized by
a band of ruffians, who, without the slightest
explanation, tore him from the presence of his
family, and hurried him away to jail, for disloyalty
to the South. The last he had seen of his
wife and four little ones was when they stood
weeping and wringing their hands on the road-side,
as his ruthless captors carried him from
their sight. He had never heard tale nor tidings
of them since, and what their fate had been he
knew not. His case was only one of a thousand
others.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“See the dire victim, torn from social life,</div>
<div class="verse">The shrieking babe, the agonizing wife.</div>
<div class="verse">See! wretch forlorn is dragged by hostile hands</div>

<div class="verse">Transmitted miseries and successive chains,</div>

<div class="verse">The fibres twisting round a parent’s heart,</div>

</div></div>

<p>This unfortunate man gave me instances of
where he had seen his neighbors hung, some
until not quite dead, and then taken down to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
take the oath of allegiance. In case they refused,
they were instantly strung up again.</p>

<p>We were so much encouraged in holding our
prayer-meetings, that we finally were bold
enough to request the privilege of having
divine service every Sabbath. This was granted,
much to our surprise, and we had the most
happy times imaginable. Oh, it was glorious
for the soul to bask in that heavenly sunlight
which God thus shed upon us in our dreary
prison.</p>

<p>About this time, I became acquainted with
Simeon B. Eckels. He was very sick, and requested
me often to pray for him. Our friendship
was as cordial as it was short, for his sickness
was unto death. The God who sent his
angel to free his apostle Peter, took our sick
brother by the hand, and led him from out the
noisome prison to the mansions above, where
care comes not, and where sickness is not
known. He died at half past ten o’clock, P. M.,
on August 22, 1862. For several days prior to
his death, I was constantly by him, and was
much gratified with the manifestations he gave
of preparation for the future. Brother Eckels
gave me the name of the church in Iowa to
which he belonged, also the names of his mother
and sister, who lived in Ohio. He requested
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
me to visit the latter. His thoughts were centred
solely upon heaven and his mother, and in
his moments of revival he would often repeat
the lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“My mother, at thy holy name,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Within my bosom is a gush</div>
<div class="verse">Of feeling, which no time can tame,</div>
<div class="verse">And which, for worlds of fame,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">I would not, could not crush.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Brother Eckels’s end was indeed one of peace
and bright serenity. At his request I preached
his funeral sermon the day succeeding his death,
from the text, “They that sleep in Jesus will
God bring with him.”</p>

<p>At the hour appointed for the funeral of the
deceased, a negro drove up with a dirty dray,
on which we supposed they intended to throw
the corpse, and cart it away like some animal’s
carcass. At this, the Colonel of his regiment,
Colonel Shaw, earnestly requested that we
might be allowed to bear the body, and thus
prevent the insult offered to the dead. This
request had the effect of causing the officers to
send for a light wagon, and in this was our
sleeping brother and comrade soldier carried to
his long home, followed by myself and a companion
or two. Gentle be his slumbers beneath
the sods of Georgia’s soil!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>Unfortunately, among some other papers, I
lost that on which I had taken the address of
Mr. Eckels’ mother, and have, therefore, as yet,
been unable to fulfil my promise to visit her.
Nothing would give me more pleasure than to
see this dear old lady, and tell her what a glorious
death-bed was that of her son. Since my
return home, I have frequently heard a sweet
song, the words of which picture before me the
last hours of Mr. Eckels. How touchingly appropriate
to the dying breath of this Christian
hero, were the lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Soon with angels I’ll be marching,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">With bright laurels on my brow&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">For my country I have fallen,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Who will care for mother now?”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Hitherto our spirits had been borne up by
the hopes of a speedy exchange; but as day
followed day, this fond hope faded, and we
began seriously to think of making our escape.
A general rise of the prisoners was proposed,
which would no doubt have been successful,
with perhaps the loss of five or ten of our
number. This I did not personally approve of,
as I was unable to travel; but still I stated to
my fellow captives, that I would put no hindrance
in their way if they should decide upon
such a course. A sufficient number not being
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
obtained to give this plan any chance of success,
it was finally abandoned for some others that
promised more success.</p>

<p>I had ascertained the distance to the river,
and also, that if we could reach the latter, we
could run down it in a skiff. I immediately
selected a comrade, broke the intelligence to
him, and obtained his consent to make a dash
for liberty. We made known our intention to
a third one, and he, too, consented to join in
the perilous undertaking. The plan of operations
was this:</p>

<p>On the first rainy night, we were to go to
some Murfreesboro’ prisoners, who had blankets,
and obtain some of the latter under
the pretense of washing them. We then intended
to make our way to the fence, and with
our knives, cut around the heads of the nails,
so that the boards could be easily pulled off.
Then filling the places we had cut with sand,
we intended to hang the blankets over the fence
so as to hide our work. At some subsequent
time, when the guards drove us up to our
room, we were going to the fence under pretense
of getting our blankets, and intended to
remain there till all was quiet. Then, tearing
off several boards, we were to make an effort
to gain our freedom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>All worked well until the night of our final
attempt, and then, unfortunately, one of our
companions was taken ill. This was the first
disappointment. The next wet night that came,
we were all well, and started; but, just as we
were about to accomplish our purpose, General
Prentiss, with several others, made a like attempt,
unknown however, to us. Of course, an
alarm was immediately raised, and the guards
were on the <i>qui vive</i>. The General’s party,
headed by him, dashed back, and hid themselves
in the cellar where we used to hold our prayer-meetings,
while we reached our own room in
safety. A Tennesseean tore up a plank from our
floor and succeeded in getting one, Lieutenant
Ward, up out of the cellar beneath; but, ere
another could be assisted thus, the guards had
captured the fugitives, and marched them out
into the yard. A short time afterward, they
were brought back into the room in which we
were, amid the jokes and laughs of the rest of
the prisoners at their non-success.</p>

<p>A few hours after daylight, a guard of fifteen
or twenty men marched in and took General
Prentiss, Captain Gaddus, Major Ward, and
several others into custody. Where they took
them we did not know; but, a few days subsequently,
I heard through Dolph, the black
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
boy, that they were put into a common jail, and
chained to the floor. From the description he
gave of it, their condition must indeed have
been horrible.</p>

<p>Think of that, all you who sympathize with
traitors, and equivocate, if you can, or dare,
upon such acts as these! You may say you do
not believe such things were done. Let me
then refer you to a case, sworn to by one of the
sufferers, upon his return home, now Lieutenant
William Pittenger, as noble a young man as
ever breathed, and formerly associate of Rev.
Alexander Clark, in the publication of “<i>Clark’s
School Visitor</i>.” It is from an official report,
given before Judge Holt, by order of the Secretary
of War:</p>

<p>“An order came for the execution of our
seven comrades who had been tried. It was at
that time entirely unexpected to us, although at
first it would not have been. Sentence of death
was read to them, and they were immediately
tied, without any time for preparation being allowed
them. They were told to bid us farewell,
and be quick about it. They were then taken
out of the prison, and we could see them from a
window, seated in a wagon, and escorted by
cavalry. In the course of an hour or so, the
cavalry returned without them. That evening,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
Captain Farackers, the provost marshal, called
upon us. We asked him how our companions
had met their fate. He told us, “like brave
men.” The next day, we conversed with the
guards who were guarding us, with one in particular,
who described the scenes of the execution.
He told us of a speech of one of these
men, named Wilson, from my regiment, on the
scaffold. He told us, also, that two of the
heaviest men had broken the ropes by which
they were suspended, and fell to the ground.
They afterwards revived, and asked for a drink
of water; which being given to them, they requested
an hour to prepare for death, and pray
before they were again hung up. Their request
was refused, and, as soon as the ropes
could be re-adjusted, they were compelled to
re-ascend the scaffold. The guard told me that
Mr. Wilson had spoken very calmly; had told
them they were all in the wrong; that they
would yet see the time when the old Union
would be restored, and the flag of our country
would wave over all that region.”</p>

<p class="noindent">Is it not passing strange that enlightened
Americans can be thus so barbarous? It is
related of a certain English judge, that a criminal
was brought before him, whom, for certain
offences, he sentenced to seven years transportation.
The prisoner’s friends immediately sent
a petition to the judge, stating that he was a
well-informed man, and if he had an opportunity,
might yet be a useful member of society.
The judge forthwith, sent for the criminal, and
thus addressed him:</p>

<p>“I understand, sir, that you are a man of
knowledge, and well-informed, and might be a
useful member to society. But see what you
have done in the face of all your knowledge.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
Now, sir, I had intended to give you only seven
years; but because you know better, I shall
double your term and give you <i>fourteen years
transportation, with hard labor</i>.” That was a just
judge, and before him should the South be tried
for the deeds she has committed during this
war.</p>

<p>What renders the offence against the noble
General Prentiss so much more aggravating, is
the fact, that he was thus treated after he had
been regularly exchanged. The man for whom
he was exchanged, General Price, had been set
at liberty, and returned to his family.</p>

<p>What apology the Southerners could offer in
this case I know not; but I suppose they might
treat the matter in the same light as they do
the wrongs inflicted upon the four millions of
human beings whom they hold in bondage.
Their reply is, when spoken to of their cruelties
to their slaves:</p>

<p>“Oh, they’re only niggers!”</p>

<p>So, in regard to General Prentiss, they might
say:</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s only a Yankee abolitionist!”</p>

<p>And shame mantles my brow as I say that
there is a class of men in the North, whom this
answer would not only satisfy, but actually
delight. Thank God that this class is a harmless
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
minority! What a sorry figure they will
cut after the war is over, and the rebels thrashed
back into the Union! They remind me of an
anecdote I once heard, of a man named John
Williams. John was a poor, lazy coward himself,
while his wife was just the reverse. Moving
to a mountainous region in Virginia, they got a
little cabin and lot of ground. One day Lucy,
his wife, was working in the garden, while John
was nursing the baby. Suddenly an old, hungry
bear was seen coming down the mountain
side, directly toward them. John instantly
dropped the child, ran to the cabin, climbed up
the ladder into the loft, and pulled the ladder
up after him, thus leaving the mother and baby
to do the best they could. Lucy, seeing her
chance of escape thus cut off, did not wait to
scold her cowardly husband, but seizing an ax,
went out to meet the bear. As soon as old
Bruin came within reach, the courageous mother
struck him on the head again and again.</p>

<p>John, as he witnessed this from the loft-window,
cried out:</p>

<p>“Quit that, you Lucy; you’ll make him
madder and madder!”</p>

<p>Lucy paid no attention to John, but continued
chopping away at the bear until she killed him.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
As the beast fell dead, John breathed somewhat
more freely, and called out:</p>

<p>“Lucy, is he dead?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure he’s dead, Lucy?”</p>

<p>“Yes! of course he is.”</p>

<p>John came down, and going to where the
dead bear lay, he looked first at it, and then at
his wife, ready, however, to start off on a run
should the brute give any signs of life. After
thus contemplating matters, he gave his collar
a jerk, and exclaimed, proudly:</p>

<p>“Hurrah, Lucy, <i>we’ve</i> killed a big bear!
blamed if we ain’t!”</p>

<p>So it is with the peace-men of to-day. They
cry now loudly for peace, and whine about the
unconstitutional arrest of a few tories. And
when it is over, and freedom triumphs, <i>their</i>
coward lips will boast of victories won over the
legions of secession. Such are the Vallandigham
traitors.</p>

<p>General Prentiss remained in close confinement
until October 6th, and during the time he had
been absent from our party. I had been taken
with a severe illness, which obtained for me admission
to a rear room of the prison, which was
dignified by the name of a hospital. Here I
enjoyed the privilege of drawing my allowance
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
of corn-meal from the commissary, and taking
it, or sending it, under guard, out to some one
in the town, to have it cooked. I got a slave,
called Aunt Susie, belonging to a widow, to
attend to mine, and she did it well. I was
forbidden to speak to her, however.</p>

<p>One day, Lieutenant Welsh came in with the
report that Aunt Susie was having great trouble.
I suspected the reason, but kept silent. The
next day, feeling well enough, I obtained permission
to take my own meal out to get it
cooked. As it happened, two black boys were
on guard, and one of these only accompanied me.
He knew all about Aunt Susie’s sorrow, and, as
he walked along, he said:</p>

<p>“Don’t b’lieve Aunt Susie ’ill be able to do
your cookin’, sah.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked I.</p>

<p>“Kase she’s in heaps o’ trouble, sah. You
see, de sheriff sold her little boy an’ gal t’oder
day, an’ she’s bin cryin’ eber since, as though
her heart ’ud break.”</p>

<p>“Do you think that sale was right?” said I.</p>

<p>“Well, now, I guess I doesn’t, sah!” was the
quick reply.</p>

<p>“Well, then, why are you in the army that
supports such doings?”</p>

<p>“Ah, sah, dey makes me shoulder my gun,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
an’ dey makes me fire, sah; but dey can’t make
me shoot low, so as to hit anybody. When I
fire, sah, I shoots ober, d’ye understand, sah?
I fires, but nobody gits hurt wid my ball, sah!”</p>

<p>“Well, why is it,” continued I, “that your
masters mix you up with white soldiers? Why
don’t they put all you blacks into regiments
by yourselves?”</p>

<p>“Yah! yah! sah,” said the slave, “dey knows
’nuff better dan dat. Dey knows we’d fight
t’odder way, if we got togedder. Yes, sah!”</p>

<p>By this time we reached Aunt Susie’s cabin,
where I found the poor creature sitting an a
stool, weeping bitterly. On her lap lay a little
boy two years old, while by her knee stood
another of four years.</p>

<p>When I entered the cabin, she sprang to her
feet in an excited manner; but when she saw
myself and guard, she became calmer.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Aunt Susie?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, sah,” she replied, amidst tears and sobs,
“I darsen’t tell you, sah, for it’ll break my poor
old heart.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, come now, Susie, tell me. If I
cannot help you, I can at least feel sorry for
you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sah, but you are kind to feel sorry for
a poor old slave like me. Dey’re sold my two
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
dear little children, and dey’ll take ’em away
to-morrow, and I knows I’ll neber see ’em no
more ’till I sees ’em up dar, sah&mdash;up dar, sah,
whar none of us’ll be sold any more.”</p>

<p>As Aunt Susie made this reply, she turned
her face heavenward, and pointed up with her
finger. In her agonized countenance, wet as it
was with her sorrowful tears, I read an appeal for
the freedom of the slave, stronger and more
touching than all the volumes and speeches
that have ever been written or made upon the
subject.</p>

<p>I could not stand it any longer, and bidding
the poor old slave good-bye, I turned away
without my bread, for my heart was full. I no
longer wondered at the strength of the language
used by Ireland’s great orator, Daniel
O’Connell, when he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“The Americans, in their conduct towards
the slaves, are traitors to the cause of human
liberty, foul detractors of the democratic principles
which I have cherished throughout my
political life. They are blasphemers of that
great and sacred name which they pretend to
honor. For in their solemn league and covenant,
the Declaration of Independence, they
declare that all men have certain ‘inalienable
rights.’ These they defined to be life, liberty,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
and the pursuit of happiness. To maintain
these, they pledged themselves with all the
solemnity of an oath in the presence of Almighty
God. The aid which they invoked
from heaven was awarded to them; but they
have violated their awfully solemn compact
with the Deity, and set at naught every principle
which they profess to hold sacred, by keeping
two and a half millions of their fellow-men
in bondage. In reprobation of that disgraceful
conduct, my humble voice is heard across the
waves of the wide Atlantic. Like the thunderstorm
in its strength, it careers against the breeze
armed with the lightning of Christian truth.
And let them seek to repress it as they may;
let them murder and assassinate in the true
spirit of Lynch law; the storm will rave louder
and louder around them till the claims of justice
become too strong to be withstood, and the
black man will stand up too big for his chains.
I hope what I am about to say is not a profanation,
but it seems as if the curse of the Almighty
has already overtaken them. For the
first time in their political history, disgraceful
tumults and anarchy have been witnessed in
their cities. Blood has been shed without the
sanction of the law, and even Sir Robert Peel
has been enabled to taunt Americans with gross
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
inconsistency and lawless proceedings. I differ
with Sir Robert Peel on many points. On one
point, however, I fully agree with him. Let
the proud Americans learn that all parties in
this country unite in condemnation of their present
conduct, and let them also learn that the
worst of all aristocracies is that which prevails
in America, an aristocracy which has been aptly
denominated that of the human skin. The most
insufferable pride is that shown by such an aristocracy.
I will continue to hurl these taunts
across the Atlantic. They will ascend the Mississippi,
they will descend the Missouri, and be
heard along the banks of the Ohio and Monongahela,
till the black man leaps delightedly to
express his gratitude to those who have effected
his emancipation. And oh! but perhaps it is my
pride that dictates this hope, that some black
O’Connell may rise among his fellow-slaves, who
will cry ‘agitate! agitate! agitate!’ till the two
millions and a half of his fellow-sufferers learn
their strength, learn that they <i>are</i> two millions
and a half! If there is one thing more than
another which can excite my hatred, it is the
laws which the Americans have framed to prevent
the instruction of their slaves. To teach
a slave to read is made a capital offence!
Shame! To be seen in the company of a slave
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
who can write, is visited with imprisonment!
Shame! And to teach the slave the principles
of freedom is punishable with death! It
may be asked, Are these human laws? Are they
not made by the wolves of the forest? No, but
they are made by a congregation of two-legged
wolves, American wolves, monsters in human
shape, who boast of their liberty and of their
humanity, while they carry the hearts of tigers
within them. With regard to the attacks that
have been made upon my countrymen by such
men, I rejoice at them. They prove to me that
the sufferings to which they have been subjected
in the land of their birth have not been lost
upon them; but that their kindly affections
have been nurtured into strength, and that they
have ranged themselves on the side of the oppressed
slave.”</p>
</div>

<p>Would to heaven that ministers of religion,
as well as statesmen would shake off their lip-fetters,
and throughout the whole nation proclaim,
as with one voice, the liberty of Gospel
love! As long as the heralds of salvation are
time-servers and caste-courters, there will be
Pharisaical hatred to God’s poor. The reader
will peruse an extract here from a sermon on
<i>Christian Courage</i> by Rev. Alexander Clark,
delivered in the mid-summer of 1862, some
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
weeks before the announcement of the Emancipation
Proclamation. The words are timely
and truthful now as then:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“To the Christian citizen, who, in this nation,
is greater than a ruler in any other, I would
say a word to-day. These are times of sorrow.
Our nation is terribly lacerated, and bleeding at
every pore. Horrid civil war hangs her black
pall over our summer skies. The clouds have
hovered long, and still they gather. All the
light we have are the vivid lightnings that
flash across our battle-fields, though every flash
reveals a flying foe, records the victory, and
thrills it in electric velocity throughout our
loyal land. Then an impenetrable darkness prevails.
We cannot yet see the ‘cloud with the
silver lining.’ We cannot hail the day of
universal peace. The thick shadows obscure
our vision. The groans we hear, and the tears
we see, hinder our exulting. Oh, the tears of
this war&mdash;what a river of them, enough, with
the added tears of the suffering slaves for lo!
these many years, to float the cruel ship that
first brought bondmen to our shores! The
graves already filled, and others filling every
day, and every where, almost crush our very
hopes. In the midst of this darkness and storm,
this carnage and blood, we would fear for the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
result, were it not for the assurance that we feel
to nerve us right from the God of nations.
<i>Be not afraid, only believe.</i></p>

<p>“And what shall we believe? What shall be
our faith? This&mdash;no more, and no less&mdash;that
this nation must first be pure, then peaceable.
Amen. Lord, help thou our unbelief! Purify
us from all sin! Take away from us all false
trust, and all man-glorying! The Lord help us
to accept universal liberty for this nation&mdash;boldly,
immediately, unconditionally, that the
sunlight of God’s favor may shine upon us once
more and for ever! May our rulers and generals,
and all Christians, accept the life-thought of
freedom to all men as the talisman of triumph
henceforth! And may none in authority, may
none in the churches or closets, be unwilling to
trust in the arm of the Lord. Oh, that the
entire people might cease trembling, and <i>believe</i>
and be bold for the right!</p>

<p>“The same Power that spoke life to the daughter
of Jairus, is able to restore our lost prosperity&mdash;is
able to return to us our national
renown. And He will, if we only believe.
Our Republic is young in years, as a child
among the nations, but it will yet be raised to
its second life, which shall be more glorious
than the first. The noise of party politicians
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
and mock mourners shall be hushed as insolence,
and the professional fault-finders who
ridicule the workings of Providence, shall be
<i>turned out</i>; and independent of their viperous
hisses over a dead Republic, it even already
pleaseth Almighty God to awake our slumbering
people to the liberty of truth. <i>His</i> name,
and not a paltry, pitiful <i>party’s</i>, shall have the
glory for a nation redeemed, and a weary, toil-worn
race emancipated!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;</div>
<div class="verse">He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat;</div>
<div class="verse">Oh, be swift my soul, to answer Him! be jubilant, my feet!</div>
<div class="verse center">Our God is marching on.’</div>
</div></div>

<p>“And even to-day, while so many are afraid
to trust God, afraid to hope that all this commotion
shall end gloriously, let us believe that
the same Power which conquered devils among
the Gadarenes, healed most desperate maladies
in the region of His pilgrimage, and raised the
cold dead to life again, will give us the great
victory. Brethren, give to the winds your
fears!</p>

<p>“A word in view of our national truth. Bless
God! in our prosperous North, that has been
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
full and free; and it shall be as enduring as the
Plymouth Rock, where it first breasted the New
World’s winter and storm. That Truth is
Christian liberty, unalloyed and untrammeled,
the Pilgrim fathers’ treasure; that is the citizen-children’s
inheritance, and it shall be perpetuated.
The ‘Mayflower’ weathered the storms of
a December Atlantic. The blood she brought
to America courses now in so many veins, and
the spirit life at Plymouth planted, is to-day so
thrilling all true Christian hearts, that this strife
must end in proclamation of a Gospel to the
poor. These we have with us always. Let the
people&mdash;the <i>whole</i> people, have the Truth&mdash;the
<i>whole</i> Truth&mdash;and nothing but the Truth. If
this include body and conscience-liberty, <i>be not
afraid of that</i>, and let the good news go forth to
captive ones. Truth is used to storms. It has
battled and beaten before. Itself bled on Calvary,
grappled with Death, and conquered the
monster on the marble floor of the new sepulchre,
and is to-day a risen Sun of Righteousness,
dawning upon the nations!</p>

<p>“The Pilgrim fires, kindled so long ago on the
cold New England shores, shall yet dart light
and warmth to earth’s remotest bounds.
America must evangelize the world. But not
yet. Not until all human fetters shall have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
been melted, and all tyranny consumed at home.
If it takes fire to purify the people and burn
out oppression, then blow, ye winds of heaven,
and fan the flames! Let our nation be the
land of slaves and sorrow no longer. Give us,
O, thou Ruler of men, a home-land of freedom
and of Gospel light! Then our missionary
efforts will be successful. Then the day of
vain mockery at our own pagan idols and
wicked worship of the world’s trinity, Gold-power-honor,
will be for ever ended. Then the
true God shall be honored, when His human
image is disenthralled, when all hearts and
voices publish the good news throughout the
land; then shall the high hallelujah melody,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Sound the loud timbrel o’er Egypt’s dark sea&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Jehovah hath triumphed&mdash;his people are free!’</div>
</div></div>

<p>ring a joy unspeakable to the benighted sons of
heathendom abroad. And the warbling melody,
sweeter and richer far than the notes of a bugle-band,
shall fill and thrill the very desert airs of
Africa. The wild men of Ethiopia shall catch
the sounding song, and leap as harts on the
mountains. The inhabitants of the far-off sea-islands
shall hear the sweet gospel pæan, and
welcome a religion that sounds liberty to the
captive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>“What music! The first measures of the anthem
have been performed in plaintive preludes,
outsighing for years, in tedious time, by the
weary bondmen of the cotton-fields. Now comes
the bold, loud bass, majestic as the march of the
whirlwind, introducing the discord of rattling
muskets, and anon the rumbling thunder-roar of
artillery and the neighing of war-horses. And
hark! for an alto, the striking and flashing of
swords, the cheers of the victors, the screams of
the wounded, and the groans of the dying! But
still the sweet ringing melody sounds on high
in octaves of glory, like the trill of a freed bird,
and as exultant as the angels’ song over the
Bethlehem hills before the day-dawn; soon the
chorus-bar shall be reached and crossed, for the
Omnipotent beats the time in downward and upward
suns; then the mournful minor strains
shall cease, the hoarse bass shall be keyed
anew for very joy, and the heavenly soprano
of peace, sung by angels and sainted choirs
above, shall blend with the glad voices of a freed
and shouting multitude in one rapturous burst
of accord,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Sound the loud timbrel o’er Egypt’s dark sea&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse indent1"><i>Jehovah hath triumphed</i>&mdash;his people are free!’</div>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Who will be afraid, since God rules? <i>Only
believe</i>, and all will be well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>“Rather let us rejoice aloud and praise the
Lord! For now a better day is dawning upon
our own dear native land. These sweet summer
mornings, with their blessed, balmy breezes,
breathe and beam it. The birds warble it. The
rain patters it. The flowers nod it. The leaves
laugh it. The sun is rising that shall flash it in
one blaze of glory the rolling globe around!
‘Be not afraid&mdash;only believe.’ ‘Amen; so let
it be.’ The infamous slave trade, and the
scarcely less infamous institution of American
slavery, <i>God is crushing out of this land for ever</i>&mdash;thanks
be to His name! Soon our poor shall
have the gospel preached to them. Soon shall
eyes that have looked so long through tears to
a tyrant master’s frown, see their prison-bands
severed in pieces, to fall in tingling music at
their feet. Soon shall the illiterate slave be
taught to read, in silent meditation, or aloud to
his children, the simple story of a Saviour’s
love. Soon shall the hearts that have sickened
at the selling of kindred flesh for gold, bound
and beat to the welcome, ‘<i>Come</i>, come unto <i>me</i>,
all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and <i>I</i>
will give you rest.’</p>

<p>“The Almighty Deliverer is working now
and, as in the days of his incarnation, there are
men now who desire in their hearts that God
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
would leave the country. They think Him unable
to pay for the loss of the herds. Men will
not believe it; but the Almighty Deliverer
works. Glory to God! Underneath our cause
are the Everlasting Arms; and side by side
with the heroic soldier, as he walks to war,
the Lord is marching on! Again and again let
it ring&mdash;let Southern hills the echo sound,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Sound the loud timbrel o’er Egypt’s dark sea&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse"><i>Jehovah hath triumphed</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">HIS PEOPLE ARE FREE</span>!’</div>
</div></div>

<p>“Be not afraid to come out, and speak out for
freedom. Only believe that the Lord will grant
it. Already it comes&mdash;the victorious march of
the Almighty! The nation’s capital He has
freed and blessed, and foundationed on consecrated
ground. The very flowers must yield a
richer fragrance there. The feathered choristers
that hop among the elms in the yards and gardens
there, so early in the morning, must strike
higher, gladder notes of praise. <i>Now</i> Washington
<i>is</i> safe. Let the conquest circle the Republic
until the waves of the Gulf and the rippling
Rio Grande shall lave the soil of liberty.”</p>
</div>

<p>Upon my return to prison I found that Aunt
Susie’s troubles had been heard of there. The
little boy and girl played close by the fence
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
during two days, and then we lost them. They
were gone to spend the rest of their lives in
chains and slavery, unless the Almighty arm
breaks every bond of every oppressor!</p>

<p>I am aware that those who would excuse the
slave system, often attempt to give conclusive
weight to their arguments by asserting that our
forefathers were slaveholders. Let me give
some facts to the contrary.</p>

<p>One day, the wife of Samuel Adams returning
home from a visit, informed her husband that a
dear friend had made her a present of a female
slave.</p>

<p>“My dear,” replied Mr. Adams, “she may
come; but not as a slave, for a slave cannot live
in my house. If she comes, she must be free.”</p>

<p>She came, and took up her <i>free</i> abode with the
family of this great champion of American
liberty, and there she continued free until her
death.</p>

<p>General Kosciusko, by his will, placed in the
hands of Mr. Jefferson a sum exceeding twenty
thousand dollars, to be laid out in the purchase
of young female slaves, who were to be both
educated and emancipated. The laws of Virginia
prevented the will of Kosciusko from being
carried into effect&mdash;1820.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>A tyrant power had captured nine hundred
and twenty Sardinian slaves, of whom General
William Eaton thus makes mention:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Many have died of grief, and others linger
out a life less tolerable than death. Alas!
remorse seizes my whole soul when I reflect that
this is indeed but a copy of the very barbarity
which my eyes have seen in my own native
country.”</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Dissipation, as well as power,”
wrote the immortal John Randolph,
“hardens the heart;
but avarice deadens it to every feeling but the
thirst for riches. Avarice alone could have
produced the slave trade. Avarice alone can,
as it does, drive the infernal traffic, and the
wretched victims, like so many post-horses, are
whipped to death in a small coach. Ambition
has its incentives in the pride, pomp, and circumstance
of glorious war; but where are the
trophies of avarice? The handcuffs, the manacles,
and the blood-stained cowhide!”</p>
</div>

<p>But to return to my narrative. One morning,
as I stood gazing at the guards about our prison,
I was forcibly struck with their appearance.
They were a new set of men, who had relieved
our old guards, the latter having been sent to
Richmond. They were all tall and ungainly,
and, in speaking, always said “har,” “sar,”
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
“whar,” and “dar.” Their most favorite exclamations
were, “tarnal Jesus,” and “I golly.”</p>

<p>As I was thus surveying these degraded
creatures, I heard one of them say:</p>

<p>“Tom, what do you always go to old Sanders’s
mill for? Why don’t you go to Mike
Adams’s mill?”</p>

<p>“Why, you tarnal fool,” was the reply,
“don’t you know there’s a good deal better clay
up at old Sanders’s than there is at Mike
Adams’s?”</p>

<p>As we were at this time under the charge of
one Captain Collins, who was more indulgent
than any of our previous keepers, we were allowed
to converse with the guards. I resolved
to settle this matter of clay-eating. So I asked
one of the fellows to whom I have just referred,
what his comrade wanted with the clay that he
got at the mill.</p>

<p>“Why, tarnal J&mdash;&mdash;s,” retorted the repulsive
brute, “and don’t you know nothin’? He
wanted it to eat, I golly!”</p>

<p>Reader, it would be impossible to describe
the personal appearance of these wretched clay-eaters,
except by the remark an Ohio lady made
upon seeing them in all their glory, in Georgia.
Said she, “<i>they do not look like fresh dead men,
but men who have been dead some time</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>Of all the negro-haters in the world, the clay-eater
is the most bitter, the cause of which is
nothing more than jealousy and a degraded
moral system.</p>

<p>While in this prison, we were permitted occasionally
to receive our dinners from outside;
but even this privilege was stopped every few
days, so that it was always altogether uncertain.</p>

<p>Commissioners having been sent to Washington,
in relation to the matter of exchanges by
cartel, they returned, and brought with them to
General Prentiss several hundred dollars, which
the General divided among the officers. Our
mess, consisting of three, received <i>one</i> dollar,
which, of course, with prices as high as they
were in Dixie at that time, was almost useless.
Sometimes we complained of our bad fare, and
asked for wheat-bread. Wheat-bread seemed
to be a standing joke in rebeldom, or rather
one of the institutions that were long since
forgotten.</p>

<p>“Wheat-bread indeed!” laughed our keepers,
“why poor flour is sixty-nine dollars per
barrel!”</p>

<p>On the 7th of October, we left Madison, Georgia,
as we hoped, for our homes. Arriving at
Augusta, we remained a short time, not being
allowed to leave the cars. During our stay,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
however, we managed to learn from the negroes
that there were but few white men in the place.</p>

<p>The loquacity of the darkies gave the guards
much trouble; that is, those who were not
Unionists themselves, and of the latter class
there were many. Captain Collins, whom I
have mentioned just before, still had us in his
charge, of which we were very glad.</p>

<p>The whites, as well as the negroes, crowded
about our cars, and among other questions, we
were asked:</p>

<p>“Well, whar did they dun get you? What
do you uns tink you uns’ll dun down here?
We uns have dun been waiting for you uns.”</p>

<p>From this place to Columbia, South Carolina,
we were received much in the same manner by
all the inhabitants. Thence we took the Charleston
railroad to Branchville, from which place,
starting due east, we struck the Wilmington
road at Kingsville. At Columbia, we were
placed for safe-keeping in the State Prison,
while arrangements were being made in regard
to the cartel. As it was supposed that we
would soon be within our own lines, more
liberty than usual was allowed us, of which I
took advantage by requesting to be allowed to
go about the town under guard. My wish was
granted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>As I was walking along, I overheard two
men talking of a young lady and two gentlemen
who had just been put into cells. There
was an apple-stand near by, and I stopped,
with the apparent intention of purchasing some
of the shriveled fruit, but really to listen to
the conversation going on between the men.</p>

<p>“I’ve no doubt,” said one, “that they’re
Yankees.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the other, “the lady was put in
for hiding and feeding a conscript.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” savagely rejoined the first, “and if
that’s so, she ought to have been hung, and not
put into prison.”</p>

<p>Upon returning to prison, I, in company
with my tried friend, Captain Studman, went
up stairs, where we both saw the lady and gentlemen
in question. She had no hope whatever
of escaping execution, and her pale, finely-formed
face, though sorrowful, was determined
in its expression. Her companions shared her
imprisonment, because they had defended her,
and to defend such an one was death or imprisonment.</p>

<p>When the appointed time for our departure
arrived, we were soon ready. While standing
in the street, drawn up in a rank, there was
near us an old man, who, whenever he had an
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
opportunity, would grossly insult us. The sun
was broiling hot, and my temper, not being
much cooler, I felt inclined to admonish this old
rebel a little. But, not wishing to offend Captain
Collins, who had treated me so well, I
refrained, and listened for some time to the
hoary-headed coward in silence.</p>

<p>A line of female negroes as long as our own,
stood close to us watching us, and commented
upon our appearance. While thus engaged,
a little dog made his way through them, and
commenced barking at, and playing with one of
our number, a captain from Missouri.</p>

<p>The captain patted the little animal, and said,
in half-joking tones:</p>

<p>“Well, puppy, I’ve got one friend in South
Carolina, anyhow.”</p>

<p>At this, the old man rushed up to the prisoner,
and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“What are you talking about? Them
things’ll hang you before you leave this
place!”</p>

<p>“Whom do you think he’s talking to, sir?” I
asked, in stern tones.</p>

<p>“He’s talking to them niggers, and he shall
hang for it, before he leaves the place.”</p>

<p>Just then, one of our number said sarcastically:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah, now, my dear old gentleman, you are
altogether mistaken. He’s not talking to your
<i>children</i>, but your dog!”</p>

<p>This enraged him beyond measure, and he
wanted to fight, and demolish the “whole crowd
of d&mdash;&mdash;d Yankees at once, and on the spot.”</p>

<p>Captain Collins, at length, thinking that he
had amused himself long enough, quietly took
hold of him, and passed him over to the guards,
who, however, were unable to appease him,
until they jagged a sharp bayonet into that
delicate portion of his corporeal organization,
where, doubtless, his feelings and his brains
were <i>seated</i>.</p>

<p>We were soon after on our way to the capital
of North Carolina. On our journey thither,
we stopped at Salisbury, where many a Yankee
head was thrust out at the car-windows in hopes
of attracting the attention of some of the kind-hearted
negroes. My unshorn beard and straggling
hair, charmed a pretty yellow maiden to
such an extent that she drew near and said:</p>

<p>“Are you a Yankee, sah?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied I, determined to profit by the
opportunity, “and I’m a very hungry Yankee!”</p>

<p>“God bless you, sah! I’ll go an’ git you a
possum leg dis minnit.”</p>

<p>With these words, she flew away, but soon
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
returned, bringing a good sized limb of “a
possum.” I must admit, even at the risk of
angering a certain lady, that the yellow angel
who thus relieved my hunger, did look very
beautiful in my eyes at the time. And as
though she read my thoughts, she asked coyly:</p>

<p>“When am you uns coming here for we uns?”</p>

<p>At this moment, a surly, vigilant guard relieved
me from the embarrassment which this
question produced, and the girl, catching a
glimpse of him, “dispersed,” without even so
much as bidding me farewell.</p>

<p>From this slave girl’s question, I was more
than ever convinced that the slaves possessed
more knowledge of their own rights, situation,
and strength, than is generally supposed. I
should not be surprised to see them some day
rise in one solid phalanx, sweep their masters
from existence, and cut their way to freedom!
And who could pity the latter? No one. We
should be compelled to say just what Mary did
to her bashful suitor.</p>

<p>One evening, as the lovers were standing on
the verandah, Willie, after immense mental
effort, asked his betrothed if he might kiss her.
He had never been guilty of the offence before.
Mary, delighted that Willie was at last becoming
sensible, gave immediate approval. Willie
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
accomplished the kiss, and fainted on the instant.
Mary stepped back, and wishing to
exonerate herself from any charges which
might be brought against her, as to doing him
injury, exclaimed loudly:</p>

<p>“You did it yourself! you did it yourself!”</p>

<p>As we traveled to Mason, near the State line,
between Virginia and North Carolina, we came
to a stream across which was a trestle bridge.
Upon reaching the bridge, a rebel soldier who
had been standing on the platform of the car,
and who was intoxicated, lost his balance and
fell through the trestle-work, a distance of full
thirty feet. He was seen to fall only by Captain
Crawford and myself. He was not missed,
however, until we had nearly reached Petersburg,
Virginia, where it was discovered when
they were about to change guards. This was
many miles away from the bridge, and we informed
Captain Collins of the accident the
moment he came in.</p>

<p>At Petersburg, we fell in with a rebel captain
who was one of those fellows who can suit all
crowds. He was much animated on the result
of the Northern elections, and said that we
would now most likely have peace. I asked
him why.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why,” replied he, “look how you are voting
over there.”</p>

<p>I did not say much, for nothing that could
have been said would have done the rebel
captain any good, and might perhaps have
brought harm to me.</p>

<p>We were obliged to cross the city to reach
the Richmond depot, and on our way we passed
by a large factory building, in which were confined
a large number both of blacks and whites,
the negroes for endeavoring to get away, and
the whites for their Union sentiments.</p>

<p>During our march to the depot, we were surrounded
by a strong guard of cavalry. Oh, how
galling it was to me think that I, a native born
Virginian, was thus driven through the streets
of the principal city of the Old Dominion, without
a shoe on my foot, scarcely rags enough to
satisfy decency, and soaked by a cold, heavy
rain!</p>

<p>At night, we were shut up in an old building
that had been used for storing tobacco and molasses.
As there were a large number of prisoners
here, awaiting exchange, every one was
obliged to shift for a resting-place as well as he
could. Of course all the best spots were appropriated
before our arrival, and we were forced
to take up our quarters in the back part of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
building. A few of the blankets captured by
the rebels at Harper’s Ferry were distributed
among us; but I, unfortunately, did not get one.
So, suffering much from the cold, I laid down in
the dirt and molasses, which formed a sort of
soft cement of an inch or two in depth. Completely
wearied out, however, I soon fell asleep,
and dreamed of the happy home in Ohio to
which I was going.</p>

<p>The next morning I was roughly aroused by
two men who stood on either side of me with
barrel-staves.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” exclaimed I, as the
two men began prying me up from the floor.</p>

<p>They did not notice my question, but like
sailors weighing anchor, wrenched again at me,
exclaiming:</p>

<p>“We’ll fetch him clear this poke! heave ho!
yo! ho!”</p>

<p>I had positively stuck so fast to the floor,
that it was only after the most strenuous exertions
I succeeded in getting loose, even with the
aid of my two rough helpers.</p>

<p>Our descriptive list did not come until ten
o’clock; but when it did, we were not long in
signing it, after which we were taken to Aiken’s
Landing, some fourteen miles south-east of
Richmond. Though a cold rain was still falling
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
at intervals, I did not complain, for I was going
home,&mdash;thank God! home!</p>

<p>Oh, how overflowing was my heart with joy
at the prospect! Every drop of rain that pattered
on my shivering form, fell upon me like
the summer shower falls upon the parched and
thirsty grass. I did not complain that I had to
march the whole fourteen miles through the
cold, mud, and snow, in my bare feet, for I
knew that this was my last hardship.</p>

<p>Our guard were not at all rigorous in our
marching, and therefore, I often had an opportunity
to converse with the teamsters. One of
them remarked to me:</p>

<p>“Did you know dere wuz a coffin laid on
Massa Jeff Davis’s door step t’odder night?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered I; “what do you think that
was done for?”</p>

<p>“I dunno, I ’spect some ob de Union men
done it to let him know dey would kill him if
he didn’t mind. He’s had his house guarded
ebber since wid two hundred men.”</p>

<p>“Well, uncle, what do you black folks think
about this war?”</p>

<p>“Why, God bless you, sah! we been looking
for Massa McClellan wid all our eyes. And if
he’d jes come leetle closer, dar’s a darky here
what’ud a leff dis State quick!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>At this instant I chanced to raise my eyes,
and there, in the distance, I beheld the glorious
old Stars and Stripes floating proudly and beautifully
upon the breeze.</p>

<p>“There she is! God bless her stars!” burst
from two hundred and sixty throats in one
breath of relief. The very clouds seemed to
break asunder and let the glorious sun down
upon our enfranchised souls. We wept, and
laughed, and shook hands, and bounded with
delight, until some time after we were taken
aboard the Federal transport, which had been
sent up the James river for us. We were soon
tossing on the ocean, and in due time arrived
without accident at Washington.</p>

<p>My first act upon landing and reaching Willard’s
Hotel, was to secure the services of a
photographer, who took myself and comrade
with the chain about our necks, and in our
rebel rags, exactly as is represented in the engraving.
The next important operation was to
clean myself, trim my beard and hair, and make
myself fit to go into decent society. This was
by no means a small undertaking; but by dint
of scrub-brushes, soaps of incredible strength,
and exercise of muscle to an indefinite extent,
I at last succeeded in accomplishing my objects.
As I left the bath-room, I noticed at the other
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
end of the hall, a tall strange gentleman, who,
for all I did not recognize him, seemed familiar
to me. However, I walked toward him, and
he did the same, coming toward me. When I
got sufficiently near to address him, I bowed
and extended my hand. He did exactly the
same. I thought he was behaving very
strangely, and with rather a grim smile I drew
back and raised myself to my full height. He
did exactly the same, and I suddenly discovered
that I had been the victim of a huge mirror,
and that I had, all the while, been mistaking
myself for a clever, gentlemanly-looking old
friend of mine. I merely relate this circumstance
to prove to the reader, that a man who
is unfortunate enough to spend six months in
Dixie, is scarcely able to recognize himself upon
his return home.</p>

<p>Home! home! that word still sounds with
strange music in my ears. Its mention brings
before my mind the little cottage in Ohio, with
its happy yet anxious faces turned up the road,
along which papa must come after being away
so many months. Home! ah, that is but another
name for the dear being, who, while I lay
wounded and languishing in the loathsome jails
of a merciless enemy, cared for the sweet babes
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
of the captive, who taught their little lips to
add a prayer for papa to their vesper offerings
at the mercy-seat, and who, weary with many
months of watching, never ceased to treasure
in her heart’s holiest recesses him who pens this
tribute.</p>

A coincidence here is worthy of notice. On the 18th of June, seven
United States soldiers were hung by the rebels at Atlanta, Georgia. They
were a part of the celebrated Chattanooga Railroad scouts, sent out on a
military excursion by General Mitchell, but who were captured and
treated as spies. One of the survivors of the party, Lieut. <span
class="smcap">Wm. Pittenger</span>, gives a full and graphic account of
their captivity and imprisonment in a book which every reader of this
work should peruse.</p>
